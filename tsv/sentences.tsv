0	9972901	TITLE	TITLE	0	A multiplexed in vivo approach to identify driver genes in small cell lung cancer
1	9972901	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lethal form of lung cancer.
2	9972901	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	Here, we develop a quantitative multiplexed approach on the basis of lentiviral barcoding with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to functionally investigate candidate regulators of tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC.
3	9972901	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	We found that naphthalene pre-treatment enhances lentiviral vector-mediated SCLC initiation, enabling high multiplicity of tumor clones for analysis through high-throughput sequencing methods.
4	9972901	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Candidate drivers of SCLC identified from a meta-analysis across multiple human SCLC genomic datasets were tested using this approach, which defines both positive and detrimental impacts of inactivating 40 genes across candidate pathways on SCLC development.
5	9972901	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	This analysis and subsequent validation in human SCLC cells establish TSC1 in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway as a robust tumor suppressor in SCLC.
6	9972901	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	This approach should illuminate drivers of SCLC, facilitate the development of precision therapies for defined SCLC genotypes, and identify therapeutic targets.
7	9972901	ABS2	ABSTRACT	7	Lee et al. report a meta-analysis of published genomic studies to identify candidate drivers of SCLC development in patients.
8	9972901	ABS2	ABSTRACT	8	They implement a genetic screening approach in mouse models of SCLC to functionally validate mTOR signaling as a key driver of SCLC development, including the TSC1 tumor suppressor.
9	9972901	BODY0	BACKGROUND	9	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) constitutes about 15% of all lung cancers and is one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer.1-3 Mortality in SCLC remains high, with a median survival of 8–10 months, as SCLC tumors are highly metastatic and become rapidly resistant to therapeutic approaches.4 The malignancy of SCLC cells is at least in part encoded by the complexity of genomic alterations induced by cigarette smoking.5 A major goal in the field has been to identify genetic drivers of SCLC growth, with the intent of eventually mirroring the successes with targeted therapies achieved in lung adenocarcinoma.6
10	9972901	BODY1	BACKGROUND	10	Inactivation of the TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressor genes is a near universal event in SCLC.
11	9972901	BODY1	BACKGROUND	11	Other recurrent alterations in SCLC genomes include inactivation of tumor suppressors such as NOTCH family members or the MLL2 chromatin remodeler, and amplification of oncogenes such as MYC family transcription factors.5,7,8 Because of the high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in SCLC cells, however, distinguishing driver alterations from passengers remains challenging.
12	9972901	BODY1	BACKGROUND	12	For instance, KMT2D (encoding MLL2) is among the largest genes (>40 kb) in the human genome; consequently, mutations within this gene have not been classified as putative drivers in the largest published genomic analyses of SCLC.5 However, functional analyses strongly suggest that MLL2 loss is an important driver of SCLC.8,9
13	9972901	BODY2	BACKGROUND	13	Genetically engineered mouse models of cancer provide a platform with which candidate cancer driver alterations can be functionally interrogated in a relevant in vivo context.
14	9972901	BODY2	BACKGROUND	14	The development of SCLC mouse models that recapitulate the inactivation of TP53 and RB1 in human SCLC has enabled the investigation of the role of additional candidate drivers of SCLC.10-12 However, thus far, progress in functionally validating potential driver mutations has been slow, with only a limited number of genes being tested since the first mouse model of SCLC was developed close to 20 years ago.7,11,13-18
15	9972901	BODY3	BACKGROUND	15	Almost all genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC entail tumor initiation via the delivery of the Cre recombinase by an adenoviral vector (Ad-Cre) to delete conditional mutant alleles of Rb1 and Trp53.7,11-13,19 Notably, adenoviral vectors do not integrate into the DNA of the transduced cells.
16	9972901	BODY3	BACKGROUND	16	Although this may be beneficial in synchronizing the time of tumor initiation, it is unsuitable for experimental studies in which sustained transgene expression or genetic tagging of transduced cells is required.
17	9972901	BODY3	BACKGROUND	17	The recent development of Tuba-seq (tumor barcoding with ultradeep barcode sequencing) has enabled the functional investigation of pools of putative driver genes in a quantitative and scalable manner in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma.20,21 In this approach, each cell transduced by a lentiviral-Cre vector (Lenti-sgRNA/Cre) and its descendants are stably labeled with a clonal identifier in the form of a random DNA barcode (BC) as well as a vector-specific identifier to distinctly label each unique genetic perturbation (i.e., sgRNA-ID or sgID).
18	9972901	BODY3	BACKGROUND	18	Thus, the importance of each sgRNA-targeted gene during tumor initiation and growth can be studied quantitatively.
19	9972901	BODY3	BACKGROUND	19	Furthermore, the presence of sgID allows simultaneous testing of multiple sgRNAs in one mouse with a pool of multiple lentiviral vectors.
20	9972901	BODY3	BACKGROUND	20	Although the Tuba-seq pipeline is in theory generalizable to any in vivo model that is amenable to lentiviral transduction and relies upon a conditionally regulated tumorigenic program, it has not yet been applied to study the genetic underpinnings of SCLC development.
21	9972901	BODY4	BACKGROUND	21	Here we present a barcoded Lenti-Cre-based mouse model of SCLC, which allows tracking of SCLC tumor clones that develop entirely within the native environment.
22	9972901	BODY4	BACKGROUND	22	We show that pre-treatment with naphthalene is key to efficient initiation of SCLC using lentiviral vectors, which enables the analysis of many tumor genotypes with Tuba-seq.
23	9972901	BODY4	BACKGROUND	23	We quantitatively assessed the impact of 40 genes on the initiation and growth of SCLC in a minimal number of mice.
24	9972901	BODY4	BACKGROUND	24	Our work validates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway as an important driver of SCLC development and demonstrates a key role for TSC1 in this pathway as a potent tumor suppressor in SCLC.
25	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	25	Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl;Rbl2fl/fl (RPR2 or TKO [triple knockout]) mice model the most prevalent subtype of human SCLC (SCLC-A, with high expression of ASCL122).
26	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	26	In this mouse model, tumor initiation is efficient and tumor progression relatively rapid (4–6 months) following intratracheal instillation with Ad-CMV-Cre.11,23 Although RPR2;R26LSL-tdTomato (RPR2T) mice developed SCLC upon transduction with Lenti-Cre (HIV-PGK-Cre backbone) (Figures 1A-1C), the overall tumor numbers were much lower than in RPR2 mutant mice using Ad-CMV-Cre despite similar titers (Table S1).11 Naphthalene is a compound that kills most club cells in the lung epithelium.24 On the basis of a previous report using naphthalene prior to lentiviral transduction to generate lung tumors in mice,25 we injected RPR2T mice with either naphthalene or vehicle (corn oil) two days prior to intratracheal delivery of Lenti-Cre (Figure 1A).
27	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	27	Naphthalene pre-treatment significantly increased both tumor number and burden in this context (Figures 1B and 1C).
28	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	28	Importantly, Lenti-Cre-initiated tumors showed histopathological characteristics of SCLC-A tumors, including high expression of ASCL1 and the neuroendocrine marker UCHL1 (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1A).
29	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	29	Tumors initiated using a different Lenti-Cre vector backbone (FIV-CMV-Cre) showed similar SCLC-A histology (Figure S1B).
30	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	30	In contrast to naphthalene pre-treatment, which increased tumor area also in the Ad-Cre model (Figures S1C and S1D), transduction with Ad-CMV-EGFP two days prior to Lenti-Cre transduction did not increase tumor number or area (Figures S1E and S1F), indicating that the pro-tumor effects of naphthalene are distinct from inflammatory responses upon adenoviral infection.
31	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	31	Cell lines derived from RPR2T mutant tumors initiated by Ad-CMV-Cre or Lenti-Cre, with or without naphthalene treatment, formed floating clusters of cells in culture, similar to classical neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines (Figure S2A).
32	9972901	BODY5	RESULTS	32	Transcriptomic analysis confirmed expression of Ascl1 and canonical neuroendocrine markers, with low levels of other transcription factors typical of other SCLC subtypes22 (Figures 1F and 1G).
33	9972901	BODY6	RESULTS	33	SCLC tumors in the Ad-CMV-Cre RPR2 model can be initiated from cGRP+ neuroendocrine lung epithelial cells (the minority of tumors) as well as from another, unknown non-neuroendocrine cell type(s) of origin.26 The presence of cells with non-neuroendocrine features (i.e., expressing the club cell marker CC10 or the NOTCH target HES1) within tumors initiated after naphthalene pre-treatment and Lenti-Cre transduction suggested that these tumors likely mostly originate from the same non-neuroendocrine cell type(s) as Ad-CMV-Cre SCLC tumors26 (Figures 1D, 1E, S2B, and S2C).
34	9972901	BODY7	RESULTS	34	Thus, naphthalene pre-treatment enhances SCLC development in the RPR2 model.
35	9972901	BODY7	RESULTS	35	Given the potential ease with which this Lenti-Cre platform could be used to inactivate genes of interest using sgRNAs and the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we next moved on to identifying potential regulators of SCLC etiology for further study.
36	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	36	To identify potential key drivers of SCLC pathogenesis, we performed a meta-analysis of 37 studies published prior to October 1, 2021, on human SCLC (Figure 2A).
37	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	37	We compiled data for not only genetic but also epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations in SCLC (Table S2).
38	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	38	This analysis identified 3,285 potential driver gene candidates that were profiled in at least 250 patients, had an alteration frequency of ≥3%, and coded for proteins with amino acid residue lengths of ≤2,000 (Tables S3 and S4).
39	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	39	Whereas the relative rarity of SCLC tumor whole-genome/exome sequencing studies meant that many of the genes were examined in 400 patients or fewer, a number of the more highly profiled cancer-related genes benefited from larger coverage, with the total patient numbers ranging from 500 to about 2,000 (Figure 2B).
40	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	40	As expected, in this analysis, TP53 and RB1 ranked first and second, respectively, as the most frequently altered genes in SCLC (Figure 2C).
41	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	41	Although several top candidate genes identified in this meta-analysis, such as COL11A1 and XPC, were previously identified to be recurrently mutated in SCLC or capable of initiating lung cancer upon inactivation,27,28 others, such as HCN1, PCDH15, and ERICH3, have been studied minimally in cancer contexts and represent novel tumor suppressor gene candidates in SCLC (Figure 2C).
42	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	42	The 3,285 candidates were enriched in signaling and cancer-related pathways (Figure 2D), including an enrichment in factors implicated in PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling (Figures 2D, S3A, S3B; Table S5).
43	9972901	BODY8	RESULTS	43	Furthermore, genes involved in DNA repair,29 Notch signaling,5 the WNT/Hippo-Merlin pathways,27 and epigenetic and transcriptional regulation8 showed high alteration rates (Figure 2E).
44	9972901	BODY9	RESULTS	44	Overall, this meta-analysis identified several candidate tumor suppressor genes and cancer pathways, most of which have not been functionally validated in SCLC (Table S6).
45	9972901	BODY10	RESULTS	45	To investigate gene candidates in the pathways identified in the meta-analysis in an in vivo model of SCLC, we combined the Lenti-Cre/naphthalene platform with tumor barcoding with ultradeep barcode sequencing, an approach initially developed to uncover cancer drivers in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma.20,21 We prioritized 40 genes from the 3,285 candidates identified in the meta-analysis, focusing on genes in key signaling pathways in SCLC (26 genes across pools 1–3; several of these genes are highlighted in Figure 2E) and novel targets with high alteration rates in patients with SCLC (14 genes in pool 4; all candidate genes tested are marked boldface type in Table S6).
46	9972901	BODY10	RESULTS	46	We transduced RPR2T;H11LSL-Cas9 (RPR2T;Cas9) mice with four independent Lenti-sgTSG/Cre pools consisting of Lenti/Cre expressing inert sgRNAs (as controls) and Lenti-sgRNA/Cre vectors targeting putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) chosen for further study from the meta-analysis (Figure 3A).
47	9972901	BODY10	RESULTS	47	Lungs were harvested at different time points for the different pools to identify possible optimal times for analysis, with no clear difference observed between the time points (see below).
48	9972901	BODY11	RESULTS	48	Both RPR2T;Cas9 and control RPR2T mice showed robust tumor formation upon Cre delivery as evidenced by tdTomato fluorescence; RPR2T;Cas9 mice showed a trend toward increased lung weights suggestive of increased tumor burden upon loss of tumor suppressor genes (Figures 3B, 3C, S4A, and S4B).
49	9972901	BODY11	RESULTS	49	To determine gene inactivation effects on SCLC initiation and progression, we isolated genomic DNA from bulk tumor-bearing lungs, PCR-amplified and sequenced the sgID-BC region in the Lenti-sgRNA/Cre vector, and analyzed the data.
50	9972901	BODY11	RESULTS	50	A previous study using RP;Ptenfl/fl conditional knockout mice showed that PTEN is a potent suppressor of SCLC development initiated by loss of p53 and RB.13 We found that inactivation of PTEN significantly increased tumor size and number in RPR2T;Cas9 mice, indicative of a potent tumor-suppressive role even with the additional inactivation of p130.
51	9972901	BODY11	RESULTS	51	Conversely, inactivation of the essential gene Pcna decreased tumor size and number, indicating that this pipeline has the ability to uncover both genotype-specific positive and negative effects on SCLC initiation and growth (Figures 3D and 3E).30 Distinct sgRNAs targeting the same gene consistently had similar effects in RPR2T;Cas9 mice (Figures 3D and 3E).
52	9972901	BODY11	RESULTS	52	In contrast, sgRNAs targeting candidate cancer drivers had little to no effect on tumor growth in RPR2T mice lacking Cas9 (Figures S4C and S4D), as expected, indicating that sgID-BC enrichment and depletion recapitulate on-target gene inactivation activity.
53	9972901	BODY11	RESULTS	53	Quantifying tumor growth using alternative metrics showed similar results, with Pten and Tsc1 inactivation increasing tumor burden and size and Arid1a and Pcna inactivation decreasing tumor burden in RPR2T;Cas9 mice, while sgRNAs had little to no effect in RPR2T mice (Figures S5A-S5D).
54	9972901	BODY12	RESULTS	54	This Tuba-seq analysis identified several new genetic modifiers of SCLC growth (Figures 3D and 3E).
55	9972901	BODY12	RESULTS	55	First, Tsc1 inactivation increased both tumor number and size, suggestive of a strong tumor suppressor role.
56	9972901	BODY12	RESULTS	56	Second, inactivation of Arid1a or Arid1b decreased tumor number and size in two independent pools, suggesting that ARID1A- and ARID1B-containing complexes normally promote rather than restrict the growth of SCLC in this genetic context.
57	9972901	BODY12	RESULTS	57	Third, inactivation of Nkx2-1 led to increased tumor number but not size, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for this lung lineage transcription factor at the time of tumor initiation.
58	9972901	BODY12	RESULTS	58	Finally, Kdm6a inactivation increased tumor number in pool 1, which was harvested at 14 weeks following tumor initiation, but showed a more modest effect in pool 2 collected at 21 weeks following tumor initiation, suggesting that KDM6A may be a more potent tumor suppressor in early lesions in this model.
59	9972901	BODY13	RESULTS	59	Taken together, these results indicate that adapting the Tuba-seq approach to an autochthonous murine model of SCLC enables identification of oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors, and greatly increases throughput of in vivo analyses.
60	9972901	BODY14	RESULTS	60	Having observed frequent alterations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in our meta-analysis (Figure 2E) and identified Tsc1 as a potent tumor suppressor gene in the RPR2 model using Tuba-seq (Figures 3D and 3E), we further investigated the role of TSC1 in SCLC.
61	9972901	BODY14	RESULTS	61	In single-guide experiments, RPR2T;Cas9 mice transduced with low titers of Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre vectors (to ensure visualization of individual tumors) (Table S1) developed both SCLC tumors and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors (giant cell lung adenocarcinoma) (Figures 4A-4C).
62	9972901	BODY14	RESULTS	62	Laser-capture microdissection followed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the sgID-BC in the Lenti-sgRNA/Cre vector showed that neighboring SCLC and NSCLC tumors arose from different clonal events (Figures S6A-S6C).
63	9972901	BODY14	RESULTS	63	Although PTEN, like TSC1, is a negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, RPR2T;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgPten/Cre did not develop NSCLC tumors, unlike mice transduced with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre where 11 of 12 mice developed giant cell lung adenocarcinoma in addition to SCLC (Figures S7A-S7C).
64	9972901	BODY14	RESULTS	64	Although these Rb/p53/p130/Tsc1 (RPR2;Tsc1) mutant tumors provide a new model for giant cell lung adenocarcinoma, we did not investigate their biology further.
65	9972901	BODY14	RESULTS	65	The neuroendocrine SCLC compartment in the RPR2T;Cas9 mice with Tsc1 inactivation showed a trend toward increased tumor number and area compared with control RPR2T mice at this time point (Figures 4B and 4C).
66	9972901	BODY15	RESULTS	66	A subset of the SCLC and NSCLC compartments had high levels of S6 phosphorylation compared with untransformed lung, suggesting elevated mTORC1 activity resulting from TSC1 inactivation (Figure 4C).
67	9972901	BODY15	RESULTS	67	S6 phosphorylation was also increased in Tsc1-knockout (KO) SCLC cell lines (derived from RPR2;Tsc1 tumors) compared with Tsc1-wild-type (WT) SCLC cell lines (Figures 4D, 4E, S7D, and S7E).
68	9972901	BODY15	RESULTS	68	In addition, Tsc1-KO cell lines displayed significantly higher sensitivity to pharmacological mTOR inhibition using AZD8055 compared with Tsc1-WT SCLC cell lines (Figure 4F).
69	9972901	BODY15	RESULTS	69	We further validated the tumor-suppressive function of TSC1 by re-expressing human TSC1 (hTSC1) in mouse tumor-derived cell lines via lentiviral transduction.
70	9972901	BODY15	RESULTS	70	Compared with the mouse SCLC cells expressing EGFP (as a control), SCLC cells (either wild-type or Tsc1-KO) ectopically expressing hTSC1 showed a significant decrease in their ability to expand in culture (Figures 4G, S8A, and S8B).
71	9972901	BODY16	RESULTS	71	In the RP mouse model, Lenti-Cre initiates SCLC inefficiently even after naphthalene pre-treatment, with only 2–4 tumors visible at 42 weeks following transduction (Figures S9A and S9B).
72	9972901	BODY16	RESULTS	72	This small number of tumors and variable tumor development made quantification difficult and suggests that this mouse model may not be readily amenable to the Tuba-seq platform.
73	9972901	BODY16	RESULTS	73	RP;R26LSL-tdTomato;H11LSL-Cas9 (RPT;Cas9) mice also developed giant cell lung adenocarcinoma following transduction with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre vector (Figures S9C and S9D), suggesting a broader role for TSC1 in regulating lung cancer development in different genetic contexts in mice.
74	9972901	BODY17	RESULTS	74	The RP and RPR2 models represent the SCLC-A subtype.
75	9972901	BODY17	RESULTS	75	In contrast, Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl;H11LSL-MycT58A (RPM) mice represent the MYC-overexpressing SCLC-N subtype (NEUROD1-high).7 We generated RP;R26LSL-tdTomato/+;H11LSL-MycT58A/LSL-Ca9 (RPMT;Cas9) mice and tested whether Tsc1 acts as a tumor suppressor in this context also.
76	9972901	BODY17	RESULTS	76	As Lenti-Cre alone generates tumors in the RPM model in only 8 weeks, we transduced RPMT;Cas9 mice without naphthalene pre-treatment (Figure S10A).
77	9972901	BODY17	RESULTS	77	Compared with RPMT;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgNeo1/Cre (Lenti-sgInert/Cre), mice transduced with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre had increased tumor number and area (Figures S10A-S10C).
78	9972901	BODY17	RESULTS	78	Of note, although RPMT;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgInert/Cre generated NEUROD1-high SCLC, as expected, there were areas of NSCLC histology in RPMT;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre, similar to our observations in the RPR2 and RP models (Figures 4A and S10D).
79	9972901	BODY18	RESULTS	79	In all, our results indicate that TSC1 is a tumor suppressor in both ASCL1-high and NEUROD1-high subtypes of SCLC and that Tsc1 inactivation also induces NSCLC development in the RPR2, RP, and RPM genetic backgrounds.
80	9972901	BODY19	RESULTS	80	Following validation of Tsc1 as a tumor suppressor gene in mouse models of SCLC, we next sought to validate the tumor-suppressive activity of TSC1 in human SCLC cells.
81	9972901	BODY19	RESULTS	81	We also investigated TSC2, the obligate partner of TSC1 within the tuberous sclerosis complex.31 We generated populations of NCI-H82 SCLC cells independently expressing six unique combinations of short epitopes (epitope-combinatorial-tag [EpicTag]32) and performed Cas9-RNA ribonucleoprotein nucleofection to generate TSC1-KO (in EpicTag 1 cells), TSC2-KO (in EpicTag 2 cells), and wild-type control cell lines (EpicTag 3–6 cells, which received non-targeting Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein) (Figures 5A and S11A).
82	9972901	BODY19	RESULTS	82	We then pooled EpicTag 1~6 NCI-H82 cells, cultured them for 21 days, and measured the relative change in epitope-tag representation using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) (Figure 5A).
83	9972901	BODY19	RESULTS	83	In this assay, TSC1-KO and TSC2-KO cells showed significantly increased expansion relative to the wild-type cell lines, making up the majority of the pool by day 21 (Figures 5B and S11B).
84	9972901	BODY19	RESULTS	84	TSC1-KO and TSC2-KO cells also showed increased phosphorylated S6 compared with wild-type cell lines (Figures 5C and S11C).
85	9972901	BODY19	RESULTS	85	In contrast to the development of NSCLC upon loss of Tsc1 at the time of initiation in the mouse models, inactivation of TSC1 or TSC2 in NCI-H82 cells did not lead to any obvious fate change toward a non-neuroendocrine fate, with no differences observed in markers indicative of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and non-neuroendocrine differentiation (Figure S11D).
86	9972901	BODY19	RESULTS	86	TSC1-WT and TSC1-KO NCI-H82 cell lines did not show significant differences in half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in response to the AZD8055 mTORC1/2 inhibitor (Figure S11E), suggesting that TSC1 inactivation at a later stage of tumor progression may not sensitize to mTOR inhibition.
87	9972901	BODY20	RESULTS	87	To further investigate TSC1 tumor-suppressive effects in SCLC, we profiled 9 human SCLC cell lines for their TSC1, TSC2, and phosphorylated S6 protein levels (Figure 5D).
88	9972901	BODY20	RESULTS	88	Two cell lines, NCI-H1694 and NCI-H146, exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated S6 compared with other human SCLC; in particular, NCI-H146 showed lower expression of TSC1.
89	9972901	BODY20	RESULTS	89	We ectopically expressed hTSC1 or EGFP in these two cell lines alongside two other cell lines with low levels of S6 phosphorylation (NCI-H526 and NCI-H446) and monitored their growth (Figure S12A).
90	9972901	BODY20	RESULTS	90	Although the phosphorylation of mTOR pathway members did not change significantly following ectopic expression of hTSC1 under the conditions examined, hTSC1-expressing human SCLC cell lines nonetheless showed significantly slower growth compared with EGFP-expressing controls (Figures 5E and S12B).
91	9972901	BODY20	RESULTS	91	Overall, these results validate TSC1 as a tumor suppressor in human SCLC.
92	9972901	BODY21	CONCLUSIONS	92	In this study, we adapted a multiplexed and quantitative method to perform medium-throughput analysis of gene inactivation in mouse models of SCLC.
93	9972901	BODY21	CONCLUSIONS	93	Using this approach, we identified TSC1 as a potent tumor suppressor in SCLC.
94	9972901	BODY21	CONCLUSIONS	94	The implementation of the Tuba-seq platform to mouse models of SCLC will greatly accelerate the functional analysis of candidate drivers of SCLC initiation and growth in vivo.
95	9972901	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	95	Lentiviral barcoding approaches have enabled breakthroughs in understanding tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and multiplexed gene perturbation effects.33-35 In this study, we show that several advantages of lentiviral barcoding (e.g., multiplexed CRISPR screening and clonality analysis using barcoding approaches) can be captured in an autochthonous, in vivo context to study SCLC development.
96	9972901	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	96	The application of Tuba-seq to mouse models of SCLC allowed us to investigate the gene perturbation effects at a much faster rate than previously capable.
97	9972901	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	97	However, the lack of histological information (as exemplified with Tsc1 loss and the appearance of a giant cell carcinoma phenotype) and necessity for single-guide validation remain limitations of this approach.
98	9972901	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	98	Nonetheless, the cost and time savings from using this approach to identify SCLC drivers cannot be overstated, and future approaches could take advantage of the lentiviral barcoding further, tracking metastasis drivers and dissecting tumor clonal evolution, for instance.
99	9972901	BODY23	CONCLUSIONS	99	Although the MSK-IMPACT panel remains a major resource for cancer genomics, including SCLC, its focus on readily actionable cancer targets (341–468 genes) is a limitation.36,37 We sought to supplement and extend the currently available dataset in our meta-analysis from 37 different studies by adding more whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing studies in addition to studies profiling specific sets of genes.
100	9972901	BODY23	CONCLUSIONS	100	Because we aggregated our datasets for the sake of simplicity rather than keeping the individual patient IDs intact (i.e., keeping only the total number of patients with a given alteration in a gene), the cBioPortal remains a distinct resource for examining mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence patterns.
101	9972901	BODY23	CONCLUSIONS	101	Nonetheless, our meta-analysis database simplifies the search for novel cancer drivers by organizing aggregated patient alteration data alongside other useful metrics such as protein information for coding genes, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression datasets, and dependency scores from the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project.
102	9972901	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	102	Increasing evidence from human tumor sections and mouse models indicates that intra-tumoral heterogeneity on the basis of epigenetic/transcriptional program in SCLC cells plays a significant role in the growth of SCLC tumors and their response to treatment.10,38-41 In contrast, our understanding of the genetic determinants of SCLC development has been hampered by limited tumor samples and the complex genome of these tumors.
103	9972901	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	103	The development of medium-throughput pre-clinical approaches such as described here will contribute to a more rapid functional validation of genes and pathways relevant to SCLC in the clinic.
104	9972901	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	104	A future goal of the field will be to explore how epigenetic and genetic mechanisms together mold SCLC development and response to various therapies to identify more personalized treatment strategies.
105	9972901	BODY25	CONCLUSIONS	105	TSC1, alongside its complex partner TSC2, was first identified as a key gene whose mutation causes tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).42 TSC patients present with several clinical features, including skin lesions, hamartomas, and subependymal giant cell tumor of the brain.42 The development of tumors in TSC patients, particularly giant cell tumors, is thought to stem from TSC1-TSC2 complex’s role as a negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, which controls multiple pathways including cell growth.43-45 We observed mTORCI activation and development of giant cell carcinoma of the lung upon Tsc1 inactivation in our mouse models of SCLC.
106	9972901	BODY25	CONCLUSIONS	106	In a recent preprint describing 3,600 SCLC tumor specimens analyzed for genomic alterations in ~300 cancer genes, ~1.5% and 0.7% of patients displayed alterations in TSC1 and TSC2, respectively.46 As we did not examine events such as silencing due to methylation or complex chromosomal rearrangements, it is possible that these percentages underestimate the prevalence of TSC1/TSC2 alteration in SCLC patients.
107	9972901	BODY25	CONCLUSIONS	107	Although only about 3%–4% of SCLC patients have TSC1 alterations according to our meta-analysis, a substantial fraction of SCLC patients possess PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway alterations (e.g., 9%–10% patients with TSC2 alterations, 11%–12% with PTEN alterations).
108	9972901	BODY25	CONCLUSIONS	108	Although cases of combined SCLC/giant cell carcinoma of the lung are rare in the clinic,47,48 our data suggest that these tumors may arise from dysregulation of the TSC1/TSC2-mTOR axis alongside RB/p53 loss of function.
109	9972901	BODY26	CONCLUSIONS	109	Our data in mice and human cells show the strong tumor-suppressive role of TSC1 in SCLC, as suggested by previous in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in mouse SCLC cell lines.49 Several recent pre-clinical studies using SCLC models have also indicated that mTOR inhibition could be a viable strategy to treat SCLC patients, especially those resistant to chemotherapy.
110	9972901	BODY26	CONCLUSIONS	110	Although rapamycin analogs (e.g., temsirolimus and RAD001), which preferentially inhibit mTORC1 rather than mTORC2, were met with little success in phase II clinical trials,50,51 ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors (e.g., AZD8055), which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, may be more promising. mTOR inhibition using AZD8055 led to decreased tumor growth and sensitization to cisplatin/etoposide therapy in a subset of patient-derived xenograft models,52 and RICTOR amplification, which occurs in 10%–15% of SCLC patients, was also shown to predict response to mTOR inhibitors in SCLC cell lines.53 Data from our study with mouse cell lines further suggest that AZD8055 may produce greater therapeutic benefit for patients whose tumors lost TSC1 function early in the course of their disease.
111	9972901	BODY26	CONCLUSIONS	111	Furthermore, mTOR inhibition rescued the efficacy of Bcl-2 inhibition as well as WEE1 inhibition in in vivo models of SCLC,54,55 leading to an ongoing phase I/II clinical trial (NCT03366103).
112	9972901	BODY26	CONCLUSIONS	112	Taken together with our data, these results suggest that ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors may produce therapeutic benefit in patients with alterations in the PI3K-AKT-TSC1/2-mTOR axis.
113	9972901	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	113	Aside from TSC1, most of the driver gene candidates tested in this study did not score significantly in the Tuba-seq analysis.
114	9972901	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	114	Although it is possible that the non-scoring genes are truly passengers, three other possible explanations exist for the high prevalence of non-scoring genes: (1) the loss of Rbl2 in the RPR2 model is already such a strong tumor-suppressive event that it masks the tumor growth effects of knocking out other tumor suppressor genes; (2) alterations in some genes/pathways are strong drivers of SCLC development (e.g., loss of RB, loss of p53, activation of the MYC family, alterations in the PTEN pathway), whereas others have more minor roles that our approach did not detect at the time point examined; and (3) some alterations may play a larger (or different) role during tumor progression rather than tumor initiation.
115	9972901	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	115	ARID1A, for example, has been shown to play a context-dependent role in liver cancer, where homozygous loss at initiation protected against HCC initiation but loss following initiation accelerated tumor growth and metastasis.56 Because our model possesses CRISPR-Cas9 activity at tumor initiation, the decrease in tumor size and number with sgRNAs against Arid1a and Arid1b is suggestive of a similar necessity for BAF complex activity at SCLC initiation and not necessarily indicative of their activity during progression.
116	9972901	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	116	This difficulty in uncoupling the effect of gene inactivation at initiation with its role at progression may limit our interpretation of the roles that non-scoring candidate drivers may play in SCLC progression.
117	9972901	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	117	Future studies, including investigating additional time points during cancer progression, are needed to uncover whether ARID1A/ARID1B and any of the non-scoring proposed candidate drivers show context-dependent or more nuanced roles in SCLC initiation and progression.

218	6940020	TITLE	TITLE	0	Axon-like protrusions promote small cell lung cancer migration and metastasis
219	6940020	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients but remains a poorly understood process.
220	6940020	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal and most metastatic cancer types.
221	6940020	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	SCLC cells normally express neuroendocrine and neuronal gene programs but accumulating evidence indicates that these cancer cells become relatively more neuronal and less neuroendocrine as they gain the ability to metastasize.
222	6940020	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Here we show that mouse and human SCLC cells in culture and in vivo can grow cellular protrusions that resemble axons.
223	6940020	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	The formation of these protrusions is controlled by multiple neuronal factors implicated in axonogenesis, axon guidance, and neuroblast migration.
224	6940020	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	Disruption of these axon-like protrusions impairs cell migration in culture and inhibits metastatic ability in vivo.
225	6940020	ABS0	ABSTRACT	7	The co-option of developmental neuronal programs is a novel molecular and cellular mechanism that contributes to the high metastatic ability of SCLC.
226	6940020	BODY0	BACKGROUND	8	Metastases are a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality.
227	6940020	BODY0	BACKGROUND	9	By the time cancer cells leave their primary site and spread to distant sites, they have acquired the ability to migrate and invade, as well as characteristics that enable them to survive and proliferate within new microenvironments.
228	6940020	BODY0	BACKGROUND	10	These phenotypes are likely driven by changes in gene expression and epigenetic programs that allow cancer cells to overcome the many hurdles that normally constrain the metastatic process.
229	6940020	BODY0	BACKGROUND	11	Despite recent advances, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms underlying metastasis remains incomplete, including how changes in molecular programs can translate into selective advantages that enable cancer cells to spread to other organs (Fidler, 2003; Obenauf and Massagué, 2015; Lambert et al., 2017).
230	6940020	BODY1	BACKGROUND	12	Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine cancer that accounts for ~15% of all lung cancers and causes over 200,000 deaths worldwide each year (Sabari et al., 2017).
231	6940020	BODY1	BACKGROUND	13	The ability of SCLC cells to leave the primary tumor and establish inoperable metastases is a major cause of death and a serious impediment to successful therapy (van Meerbeeck et al., 2011; Farago and Keane, 2018).
232	6940020	BODY1	BACKGROUND	14	SCLC is one of the most metastatic human cancers, with over 60% of SCLC patients presenting with disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis, often including liver, bone, brain, and secondary lung metastases (Nakazawa et al., 2012; Riihimäki et al., 2014).
233	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	15	Molecular analyses to understand metastatic progression of human cancer are often limited by difficulties in accessing tumor samples at defined stages.
234	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	16	This problem is especially true for SCLC, since patients with metastatic disease rarely undergo surgery (Barnes et al., 2017).
235	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	17	Genetically engineered mouse models of human SCLC recapitulate the genetics, histology, therapeutic response, and highly metastatic nature of the human disease (Kwon and Berns, 2013; Gazdar et al., 2015; Rudin et al., 2019).
236	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	18	These genetically engineered mouse models recapitulate cancer progression in a controlled manner and allow for the isolation of primary tumors and metastases directly from their native microenvironment.
237	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	19	Recently, we and others have used mouse models to uncover gene expression programs that are altered in SCLC metastases (Denny et al., 2016; Semenova et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018).
238	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	20	While SCLC cells display features of neuroendocrine cells, the gene expression programs in metastatic SCLC include not only genes normally expressed in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells but also those expressed in neurons (Carney et al., 1982; Cutz, 1982; Broers et al., 1987; Anderson et al., 1988).
239	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	21	Higher levels of the neuronal markers such as NSE (neuron-specific enolase) correlate with shorter survival and more metastatic disease in SCLC patients (Carney et al., 1982; van Zandwijk et al., 1992; Dong et al., 2019).
240	6940020	BODY2	BACKGROUND	22	Broad neuronal gene expression programs are enriched in metastases from mouse models of SCLC, however, whether SCLC cells actually gain neuronal characteristics and whether neuronal features are key regulators of metastatic ability has not been previously characterized (Denny et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018; Böttger et al., 2019).
241	6940020	BODY3	BACKGROUND	23	Here we find that the metastatic state of SCLC can include the growth of protrusions that resemble axons.
242	6940020	BODY3	BACKGROUND	24	These axon-like growths increase the ability of SCLC cells to migrate and metastasize, thus representing a cellular mechanism that enhances the metastatic ability of SCLC cells that have transitioned to a more neuronal cell state.
243	6940020	BODY4	RESULTS	25	To investigate SCLC migration, we developed an assay in which SCLC cells, which classically grow in culture as floating spheres or aggregates, are grown as a monolayer under Matrigel (Denny et al., 2016 and Materials and methods).
244	6940020	BODY4	RESULTS	26	Unexpectedly, we noticed that cells from some SCLC cell lines (N2N1G, 16T, 6PF) derived from the Rbf/f;Trp53f/f (DKO) and Rbf/f;Trp53 f/f;p130f/f (TKO) genetically engineered mouse models form long cellular protrusions into cell-free spaces (Figure 1A–B).
245	6940020	BODY4	RESULTS	27	To determine whether these structures specifically project into cell-free areas or they also exist within monolayers, we cultured a minor fraction of fluorescently-labeled, GFPpositive SCLC cells with control SCLC cells.
246	6940020	BODY4	RESULTS	28	We found that SCLC cells also form protrusions when they are in close contact with surrounding cancer cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).
247	6940020	BODY4	RESULTS	29	Similar mixing experiments performed in subcutaneous allografts also documented the growth of protrusions by SCLC cells in vivo (Figure 1C–D).
248	6940020	BODY4	RESULTS	30	Finally, similar structures also extend from SCLC micro-metastases in the liver in the autochthonous TKO mouse model and after intravenous transplantations of SCLC cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C).
249	6940020	BODY8	RESULTS	31	Human SCLC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) recapitulate many important features of the human disease (e.g. Saunders et al., 2015; Gardner et al., 2017).
250	6940020	BODY8	RESULTS	32	To label rare cancer cells within human SCLC PDXs and identify whether they had protrusions in unperturbed tumors, we used DiI tracing. DiI is a lipophilic dye that diffuses within cell membranes and has been widely employed to label projections from individual neurons (Mufson et al., 1990; Heilingoetter and Jensen, 2016).
251	6940020	BODY8	RESULTS	33	Protrusions from SCLC cells were easily identifiable in two out of three PDX models (Figure 1E–F).
252	6940020	BODY8	RESULTS	34	Furthermore, human NCI-H446 SCLC cells formed long protrusions into cell-free areas in the 2D culture system (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E) and when grown as xenografts (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F).
253	6940020	BODY8	RESULTS	35	Other human and mouse cells had a variable capacity to form protrusions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H, Supplementary file 1: Key Resources table, and Supplementary file 2–table 1).
254	6940020	BODY9	RESULTS	36	These observations indicated that at least a subset of SCLC cells, which are often described as being ‘small round blue’ cells, can develop long cellular protrusions.
255	6940020	BODY9	RESULTS	37	We next sought to investigate the nature of these protrusions and uncover their possible role in metastatic SCLC.
256	6940020	BODY10	RESULTS	38	SCLC cells express typical neuroendocrine genes but also neural and neuronal genes (Carney et al., 1982; Cutz, 1982).
257	6940020	BODY10	RESULTS	39	This observation led us to investigate whether the protrusions were similar to neuronal axons or dendrites.
258	6940020	BODY10	RESULTS	40	We identified a list of 69 genes classically associated in the scientific literature with axonogenesis and axon guidance, and found that many of these genes are expressed in at least subsets of primary human SCLCs (George et al., 2015) (Supplementary file 2–table 2).
259	6940020	BODY10	RESULTS	41	Thus, the gene expression programs controlling axonal growth in neuronal cells are also present in SCLC cells.
260	6940020	BODY10	RESULTS	42	We previously performed gene expression analyses on purified cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from two mouse models of SCLC (Denny et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018).
261	6940020	BODY10	RESULTS	43	In these studies, we found a general increase in the expression of neuronal gene expression programs during tumor progression, with broad expression of the selected candidate genes in metastatic SCLCs, indicating that murine SCLC tumors and cell lines derived from these tumors represent a tractable system with which to investigate neuronal programs in SCLC (Supplementary file 2–table 3).
262	6940020	BODY10	RESULTS	44	Pathway and process enrichment analysis on these 69 genes confirmed their connection with axon guidance, neuron migration, and nervous system development (Supplementary file 2–table 4).
263	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	45	To further investigate the nature of these SCLC protrusions, we assessed their expression of canonical axonal and dendritic proteins.
264	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	46	The protrusions that form from murine and human SCLC cell lines uniformly expressed neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1).
265	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	47	More importantly, these protrusions were positive for the axonal marker TAU while expression of the dendritic marker MAP2 was undetectable (Figure 2A–B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C).
266	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	48	Tuj1positive, TAUpositive protrusions were also observed in vivo emanating from SCLC cells in the liver of TKO mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).
267	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	49	Furthermore, 29/79 (37%) human primary SCLC tumors stained moderately or strongly positive for TAU (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B).
268	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	50	Most axonogenesis and neuronal migration genes were undetectable in a single-cell RNA-seq analysis of adult lung epithelial cells, which included neuroendocrine cell, further suggesting that these programs are turned on during tumorigenesis (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C) (Ouadah et al., 2019).
269	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	51	Immunostaining for the axonal marker GAP43 (which is highly expressed in the metastatic SCLC state; see below) did not uncover any positive normal lung epithelial cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D).
270	6940020	BODY11	RESULTS	52	Together, these observations indicate that axonal programs are gained during SCLC progression and suggested that the protrusions from SCLC cells are axon-like.
271	6940020	BODY17	RESULTS	53	We quantified the length of protrusions and found that they were often 5 to 10 times longer than the diameter of the cell body (~8 µm) (Figure 2C).
272	6940020	BODY17	RESULTS	54	The length and the frequency of these axon-like protrusions suggested that they might influence the behavior of SCLC cells.
273	6940020	BODY17	RESULTS	55	We investigated and quantified the features of SCLC cells with and without protrusions using time-lapse microscopy.
274	6940020	BODY17	RESULTS	56	Initial observations of mouse SCLC cells showed that the protrusions were very dynamic (Figure 2D and Video 1).
275	6940020	BODY17	RESULTS	57	In these videos, we noticed that the protrusions resembled cellular processes that have been described in neuroblasts and with the movement of SCLC cells along these protrusions reminiscent of neuronal tangential migration exhibited by neuroblasts (Lois et al., 1996; Oudin et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2015) and interneurons (Leclech et al., 2019).
276	6940020	BODY17	RESULTS	58	Indeed, when we quantified the movement of SCLC cell along protrusions, SCLC cell lines that form protrusions (16T and N2N1G cell lines) displayed increased saltatory activity compared to SCLC cells that do not form protrusions (KP22 cell line) (Figure 2D–H and Video 2, 3, and 4).
277	6940020	BODY17	RESULTS	59	The velocity of SCLC cells that form protrusions was also greatly increased compared to cells that do not form protrusions (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).
278	6940020	BODY18	RESULTS	60	Together, these results indicate that SCLC cells can generate axon-like protrusions and that these projections facilitate migration in a manner that is qualitatively similar to neuroblast migration during brain development.
279	6940020	BODY19	RESULTS	61	To investigate the functional importance of these axon-like protrusions and their regulation, we focused on 13 genes (out of the 69 genes selected above) that encode for proteins functionally involved in diverse aspects of axon formation, axon guidance, and neuronal migration (Supplementary file 2–table 5).
280	6940020	BODY19	RESULTS	62	These 13 genes are all expressed in at least a subset of human SCLC tumors (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) (data from George et al., 2015).
281	6940020	BODY19	RESULTS	63	We excluded gene families for which functional overlap and compensatory mechanism were likely.
282	6940020	BODY19	RESULTS	64	STRING analysis and literature searches confirmed that these 13 candidates had a significant connection with biological processes related to neurogenesis and the regulation of neuron projection development.
283	6940020	BODY19	RESULTS	65	These proteins were not often connected with one another and thus likely contribute to distinct aspects of these biological processes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 2–table 6).
284	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	66	A better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the upregulation of gene programs linked to axonogenesis and neuronal migration may help us understand the functional role of these gene programs in SCLC cells.
285	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	67	SCLC tumors have been divided in major subtypes driven by key transcription factors (Rudin et al., 2019).
286	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	68	In human tumors (George et al., 2015), the 13-gene signature correlated more closely with the ‘SCLC-N’ subtype, driven by the transcription factor NEUROD1, and both human cell line NCI-H446 and the PDX model LU86 (Saunders et al., 2015) belong to this subtype (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C).
287	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	69	The murine cell lines used to study protrusions in this study are of the ‘SCLC-A’ subtype (driven by the transcription factor ASCL1), even though the correlation between the 13-gene signature and ASCL1 expression was weak in mouse tumors (Yang et al., 2018) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C).
288	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	70	We also found no correlation between ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression and the ability to grow protrusions in other human cell lines (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and Supplementary file 2–table 1).
289	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	71	Thus, the ability to grow protrusions may exist across SCLC subtypes.
290	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	72	We and others have identified a role for the NFIB transcription factor in SCLC metastasis and the induction of gene programs linked with neuronal differentiation (Denny et al., 2016; Semenova et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016).
291	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	73	Notably, the 13-gene signature correlated with high NFIB expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C).
292	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	74	NFIB knock-down in mouse SCLC cells that had high NFIB levels and formed protrusions did not result in the global downregulation of the 13-gene signature, but was sufficient to reduce the formation of protrusions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F).
293	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	75	Overexpression of NFIB in SCLC mouse cells with low NFIB levels and without protrusions was not sufficient to lead to the upregulation of the entire set of 13 genes or to induce the growth of protrusions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,G).
294	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	76	Thus, while NFIB upregulation may be important in the induction of neuronal programs in SCLC cells, the upstream factors that control neuronal programs specifically associated with axonogenesis and migration in SCLC remain to be fully characterized.
295	6940020	BODY20	RESULTS	77	These experiments led us to more specifically test the role of the 13 selected genes in the formation of protrusions and the role of these protrusions in cell migration and metastasis.
296	6940020	BODY21	RESULTS	78	In the 25 human SCLC cell lines analyzed in the Cancer Dependency Map project, knock-down of these 13 genes rarely affected the growth of SCLC cells in culture, consistent with these genes influencing aspects of cell physiology not related to the cell cycle (Supplementary file 2–table 7 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A).
297	6940020	BODY21	RESULTS	79	We performed immunostaining for one of these 13 proteins (GAP43) and found that ~50% of human primary SCLC tumors stained moderately or strongly positive (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B), further supporting a role for neuronal programs linked to axonogenesis and migration in SCLC.
298	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	80	The 13-gene signature was overall more highly expressed in N2N1G cells, which are derived from a lymph node metastasis and grow protrusions compared to KP22 cells that do not grow protrusions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C).
299	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	81	We first knocked-down each of these 13 genes with two shRNAs in N2N1G cells.
300	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	82	We confirmed stable knock-down by RT-qPCR (Supplementary file 2–table 8) and quantified the development of protrusions in the monolayer culture assay.
301	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	83	Knock-down of 11 of the 13 genes significantly reduced the number of protrusions with at least one shRNA (Figure 3A–B and Figure 3—figure supplement 3A).
302	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	84	Knock-down of multiple factors normally implicated in distinct steps of axonal growth reduced the development of protrusions from SCLC cells, thus further bolstering the notion that these protrusions are similar to neuronal axons.
303	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	85	Knock-down of the many genes involved in axon formation, axonal guidance, and neuronal migration also reduced cell migration (Figure 3B).
304	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	86	Quantification of cell migration showed that inhibition of migration correlated with loss of the axon-like protrusions (Figure 3C–D).
305	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	87	We validated the knock-down for two of the top candidates, Gap43 and Fez1 genes, by immunoblot for the corresponding proteins in N2N1G cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–C).
306	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	88	We further validated the effects of knocking down these two factors on the growth of protrusions and cell migration in a second SCLC cell line (16T; Figure 3E–J and Figure 3—figure supplement 3D–E).
307	6940020	BODY22	RESULTS	89	Finally, we found that knock-down of Gap43 and Fez1 reduced the ability of SCLC 16T and N2N1G cells to migrate out of 3D spheroids in Matrigel (Figure 3—figure supplement 3F–G).
308	6940020	BODY30	RESULTS	90	Together, these data show that SCLC cells with axon-like protrusions migrate in culture similar to what has been described for neuroblasts and that disruption of these protrusions by knocking down a variety of diverse genes involved in axonogenesis and neuronal migration also reduces SCLC migration.
309	6940020	BODY31	RESULTS	91	The link between axon-like protrusions and migration in vitro led us to investigate whether these axon-like protrusions promote the metastatic ability of SCLC cells in vivo.
310	6940020	BODY31	RESULTS	92	In support of this idea, we found that the expression of neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin and TAU was barely detectable in non-metastatic tumors in the lungs of TKO mice 3 months after cancer initiation while a majority of later stage tumors stained strongly positive for both proteins (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B).
311	6940020	BODY31	RESULTS	93	GAP43 was detectable in 6/9 human SCLC metastases analyzed (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).
312	6940020	BODY31	RESULTS	94	We also found a significant increase of key genes involved in axonogenesis and neuronal migration in metastases compared to primary tumors in a mouse model of SCLC (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).
313	6940020	BODY32	RESULTS	95	To test the role of these protrusions in the metastatic process in vivo, we investigated whether SCLC cells with Gap43 or Fez1 knocked-down had reduced metastatic ability.
314	6940020	BODY32	RESULTS	96	The products of these genes are thought to regulate axonal development in distinct manners but knock-down of each reduced the formation of protrusions and cell migration in culture.
315	6940020	BODY32	RESULTS	97	We first assessed whether Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down reduced the metastatic ability of mouse N2N1G SCLC cells after intravenous transplantation of control and knock-down cells into recipient mice.
316	6940020	BODY32	RESULTS	98	Knock-down of each of these pro-protrusion factors significantly reduced the number of metastases as assessed by tumor counts at the surface of the liver 4–5 weeks after intravenous injection (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B).
317	6940020	BODY32	RESULTS	99	To determine whether GAP43 and FEZ1 are simply required for tumor growth in vivo, we transplanted Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down cells subcutaneously and quantified tumor growth.
318	6940020	BODY32	RESULTS	100	Knock-down of these genes had no effect on subcutaneous tumor growth suggesting that the effects on metastatic ability likely represent the disruption of phenotypes uniquely associated with the metastatic process (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C).
319	6940020	BODY32	RESULTS	101	We repeated these experiments with two independent shRNAs for each gene in both N2N1G and 16T SCLC cells, which confirmed that Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down reduced the formation of liver metastases after intravenous injection of SCLC cells (Figure 4A–H and Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–E).
320	6940020	BODY38	RESULTS	102	The absence of growth defects in subcutaneous tumors following Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down suggested that these genes may affect earlier steps of the metastatic cascade.
321	6940020	BODY38	RESULTS	103	To test this, we performed similar intravenous transplant experiments but quantified the presence of SCLC cells in the liver 2 days after injection (Figure 4I).
322	6940020	BODY38	RESULTS	104	Quantification of GFPpositive cancer cells in the liver by flow cytometry documented a significant reduction in metastatic seeding by SCLC cells with Gap43 or Fez1 knocked-down (Figure 4J–M and Figure 4—figure supplement 2F–I).
323	6940020	BODY38	RESULTS	105	Thus, reduced expression of genes associated with the formation of axon-like protrusions affects early metastatic seeding of SCLC cells in the liver, which ultimately translates to reduced metastatic burden.
324	6940020	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	106	While metastasis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCLC patients, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and no therapeutic strategies exist to prevent metastatic spread or specifically treat metastatic SCLC.
325	6940020	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	107	Here we investigated the function of neuronal gene expression programs in metastatic SCLC.
326	6940020	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	108	We found that SCLC cells can grow axon-like protrusions and that these protrusions contribute to the migratory and metastatic phenotypes of these cells.
327	6940020	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	109	This study identifies a cellular mechanism by which a neuroendocrine-to-neuronal transition promotes metastasis of SCLC cells.
328	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	110	The expression of neuronal factors in SCLC has been known for more than three decades and has been used as a marker for disease progression (Carney et al., 1982; Cutz, 1982; Broers et al., 1987; Anderson et al., 1988).
329	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	111	However, whether neuronal programs in SCLC cells play a direct role in SCLC progression has not been rigorously investigated.
330	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	112	We uncovered the formation of axon-like protrusions as one functional aspect of neuronal differentiation in SCLC and provide data to support a role for these protrusions in migration and metastasis.
331	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	113	It is likely that other phenotypes usually associated with neurons beyond these axon-like protrusions also contribute to the expansion and the spread of SCLC cells.
332	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	114	Furthermore, these axon-like protrusions may have other functions beyond facilitating metastatic seeding to the liver, which may including facilitating SCLC cell migration within the primary tumor, intravasation into the bloodstream, and movement within the parenchyma during metastatic expansion (Shibue et al., 2012).
333	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	115	Future investigation of the roles of axon-like protrusions in SCLC will likely benefit from additional genetic analyses as well as high-resolution in vivo imaging methods.
334	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	116	Recent evidence suggests that several other human tumor types also increase the expression of neuronal programs as they become more metastatic, especially to the brain (Wingrove et al., 2019).
335	6940020	BODY40	CONCLUSIONS	117	It will be important for future studies to determine if aspects of the neuronal program also contribute to the striking ability of SCLC cells to seed and expand in the brain (Lukas et al., 2017).
336	6940020	BODY41	CONCLUSIONS	118	Our data indicate that SCLC metastasis is facilitated by the development of axon-like protrusions, however other molecular mechanisms certainly also increase the probability that a cancer cell will successfully overcome all the hurdles that limit the development of tissue destructive metastases.
337	6940020	BODY41	CONCLUSIONS	119	For instance, we found that knock-down of Dcx (coding for Doublecortin) has little to no effect on the number of protrusions but strongly inhibits migration in our 2D Matrigel assay (Figure 3A–B), thus Doublecortin may promote SCLC migration independent from an impact on protrusion formation.
338	6940020	BODY42	CONCLUSIONS	120	The formation of protrusions in SCLC cells is controlled by pathways previously implicated in the formation of axons and the migration of neuronal cells but it is unclear how the expression of these pro-protrusion genes is coordinated.
339	6940020	BODY42	CONCLUSIONS	121	Existing data support a role for the NFIB transcription factor across SCLC subtypes in the up-regulation of neuronal gene programs in general and gene programs associated more specifically with axonogenesis and neuronal migration (this study and Denny et al., 2016; Semenova et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016).
340	6940020	BODY42	CONCLUSIONS	122	However, it is likely that a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors contributes to the ability of SCLC to grow protrusions (Qadeer et al., 2019).
341	6940020	BODY42	CONCLUSIONS	123	Adhesion molecules and other factors in the tumor microenvironment are also likely to contribute to the formation of protrusions in vivo (Guo et al., 2000).
342	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	124	Could an understanding of the molecular and cellular processes related to axon-like protrusions in SCLC cells ultimately be translated into clinical benefit for SCLC patients?
343	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	125	Because NFIB is an important regulator of neuronal gene programs in SCLC cells, targeting this transcription factor may help inhibit SCLC metastatic potential in the future; one possible strategy could be the use of targeted proteolysis (Paiva and Crews, 2019).
344	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	126	Another option could be to target individual factors in the axonogenesis and neuronal migration programs.
345	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	127	Several of these factors may be required to drive these programs and these programs may not be as critical for brain function in adults as they are during development.
346	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	128	Previous studies on SCLC have targeted the CXCR4 chemokine receptor due to its role in cell adhesion and migration and its expression in SCLC cells (Burger et al., 2003; Teicher, 2014; Taromi et al., 2016).
347	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	129	Interestingly, CXCR4 also contributes to the formation of axon-like protrusions (Figure 3).
348	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	130	In a recent clinical trial in SCLC patients, CXCR4 inhibition was well tolerated but this inhibition did not significantly reduce disease progression (Salgia et al., 2017).
349	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	131	However, agents that reduce the ability of cancer cells to overcome early barriers of metastatic seeding will likely need to be employed in specific settings where inhibition of the metastatic process would logically provide clinical benefit.
350	6940020	BODY43	CONCLUSIONS	132	For example, in patients with resectable SCLC, inhibition of pro-metastatic pathways in the neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant setting could reduce the frequency or multiplicity of metastatic relapse.
351	6940020	BODY44	CONCLUSIONS	133	More generally, the transition from a neuroendocrine state to a state where neuroendocrine differentiation is decreased but neuronal differentiation is increased may be related to the exceptional plasticity of SCLC cells (reviewed in Yuan et al., 2019).
352	6940020	BODY44	CONCLUSIONS	134	The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to contribute to migration, metastasis, and resistance to treatment in many cancer contexts and may play a role in SCLC (Singh and Settleman, 2010; Cañadas et al., 2014; Krohn et al., 2014; Allison Stewart et al., 2017; O'Brien-Ball and Biddle, 2017).
353	6940020	BODY44	CONCLUSIONS	135	Vascular mimicry (or epithelial-to-endothelial transition (EET) Yuan et al., 2019) may also contribute to tumor growth and response to treatment in SCLC (Williamson et al., 2016).
354	6940020	BODY44	CONCLUSIONS	136	Similarly, Notch-induced dedifferentiation to a non-neuroendocrine state can generate an intra-tumoral niche that protects neuroendocrine SCLC cells (Lim et al., 2017).
355	6940020	BODY44	CONCLUSIONS	137	Based on our results and recent observations in other cancers (Wingrove et al., 2019), we propose that an epithelial-to-neuronal transition contributes to key aspects of cancer metastasis.
356	6940020	BODY44	CONCLUSIONS	138	Further characterization of this neuronal state in both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancers is likely to uncover novel mechanisms of cancer progression and may ultimately offer new insight into anti-metastasis strategies in the clinic.

369	6940020	BODY46	METHODS	151	All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative (MycoAlert Detection Kit, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).
370	6940020	BODY47	METHODS	152	Silicone inserts (ibidi 80209, Grafelfing, Germany) were attached to wells in 12-well (up to two inserts) or 24-well (one insert) plates pre-coated with poly-D-lysine for 15 min (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).~8×105 cells were seeded to each chamber of the insert in 100 µL resulting in cells at ~80–90% confluency.

383	6940020	BODY49	METHODS	165	The position of the cell nucleus was tracked in each frame using the Manual Tracking plugin to obtain the distance migrated by the nucleus per frame and the average cell velocity over the entire video.
384	6940020	BODY49	METHODS	166	Neuronal cell migration occurs via three steps: the cell extends a leading process, the nucleus translocates into the leading process via nucleokinesis, and the cell loses its trailing process.
385	6940020	BODY49	METHODS	167	To quantify translocation events, we quantified the fractions of steps taken by each cell that were over 8 µm, which represents the length of one cell body and a nuclear translocation event.

439	6141466	TITLE	TITLE	0	Recurrent WNT pathway alterations are frequent in relapsed small cell lung cancer
440	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Nearly all patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) eventually relapse with chemoresistant disease.
441	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	The molecular mechanisms driving chemoresistance in SCLC remain un-characterized.
442	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	Here, we describe whole-exome sequencing of paired SCLC tumor samples procured at diagnosis and relapse from 12 patients, and unpaired relapse samples from 18 additional patients.
443	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Multiple somatic copy number alterations, including gains in ABCC1 and deletions in MYCL, MSH2, and MSH6, are identifiable in relapsed samples.
444	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	Relapse samples also exhibit recurrent mutations and loss of heterozygosity in regulators of WNT signaling, including CHD8 and APC.
445	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	Analysis of RNA-sequencing data shows enrichment for an ASCL1-low expression subtype and WNT activation in relapse samples.
446	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	7	Activation of WNT signaling in chemosensitive human SCLC cell lines through APC knockdown induces chemoresistance.
447	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	8	Additionally, in vitro-derived chemoresistant cell lines demonstrate increased WNT activity.
448	6141466	ABS0	ABSTRACT	9	Overall, our results suggest WNT signaling activation as a mechanism of chemoresistance in relapsed SCLC.
449	6141466	ABS1	ABSTRACT	10	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients frequently relapse and become resistant to chemotherapy.
450	6141466	ABS1	ABSTRACT	11	Here, the authors analyse the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of primary and relapsed SCLC patients as well as in vitro models, and discover that activation of WNT signalling can drive chemotherapy resistance.
451	6141466	BODY0	BACKGROUND	12	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death.
452	6141466	BODY0	BACKGROUND	13	Nearly 13% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)1.
453	6141466	BODY0	BACKGROUND	14	SCLC is a highly aggressive malignancy that is characterized by a short doubling time and tendency to metastasize early.
454	6141466	BODY0	BACKGROUND	15	Although patients with newly diagnosed SCLC often achieve dramatic responses to initial treatment with platinum doublet chemotherapy, most patients relapse with rapidly worsening disease that is resistant to further treatment.
455	6141466	BODY0	BACKGROUND	16	The median survival in patients with SCLC is ~7 months, and this has not substantially changed in the past few decades—owing to the lack of effective treatment options for patients with relapsed disease2.
456	6141466	BODY0	BACKGROUND	17	Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of treatment resistance and identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities is necessary to improve outcomes in patients with relapsed SCLC.
457	6141466	BODY1	BACKGROUND	18	SCLC is characterized by a variety of genomic alterations and relatively higher mutation rate per megabase (Mb) compared to many other malignancies3,4, and is associated with heavy tobacco smoking.
458	6141466	BODY1	BACKGROUND	19	Comprehensive genomic analyses of human SCLC have shown inactivation of the tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 to be a characteristic feature of this disease3.
459	6141466	BODY1	BACKGROUND	20	SCLC is a high grade neuroendocrine tumor, and differentiation in SCLC is driven predominantly by the lineage factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1, which play a crucial role in cell survival5,6.
460	6141466	BODY1	BACKGROUND	21	Although subtyping SCLCs based on the lineage survival factor they overexpress is not performed in the clinical setting, ASCL1 and NEURDO1 predominant SCLCs are characterized by significant differences in their genetic and epigenetic profiles.
461	6141466	BODY1	BACKGROUND	22	In addition to these alterations, SCLCs also show alterations in pathways that regulate neuroendocrine differentiation (such as NOTCH signaling) and amplifications in oncogenes such as SOX2, MYC, MYCL, and MYCN.
462	6141466	BODY1	BACKGROUND	23	While the genomic landscape of treatment-naive SCLC has been well described by different groups, very few samples profiled to date have been obtained from patients with relapsed disease in these studies3,7–9.
463	6141466	BODY1	BACKGROUND	24	Therefore, the genomic landscape of relapsed SCLC and the molecular mechanisms that drive chemotherapy resistance in this disease continue to remain poorly defined.
464	6141466	BODY2	BACKGROUND	25	The primary objective of our study is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance in patients with relapsed SCLC, as a means to circumvent traditional chemotherapy resistance with novel therapeutic approaches.
465	6141466	BODY2	BACKGROUND	26	To this end, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of SCLC tumor samples obtained from 30 patients following relapse (relapse samples).
466	6141466	BODY2	BACKGROUND	27	Representative slides from these samples were reviewed and confirmed to be SCLC by two pathologists independently (Supplementary tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Data).
467	6141466	BODY2	BACKGROUND	28	Corresponding chemotherapy-naive tumor samples were available for 12 patients (treatment-naive samples).
468	6141466	BODY2	BACKGROUND	29	Additionally, we performed tumor RNA-sequencing of samples obtained at relapse from 18 of the 30 patients.
469	6141466	BODY2	BACKGROUND	30	Here we highlight the key similarities and differences in the genomic landscape of primary and relapsed SCLCs.
470	6141466	BODY2	BACKGROUND	31	We also demonstrate how integrative analysis of RNA and DNA sequencing data from these tumors identify activation of canonical WNT signaling as a likely mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in SCLCs.
471	6141466	BODY3	RESULTS	32	Consistent with previously published studies, the total tumor mutation burden (TMB) of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) was high for both chemotherapy-naive and relapsed samples, due to the strong association between heavy cigarette smoking and SCLC tumorigenesis3,4,8,9.
472	6141466	BODY3	RESULTS	33	TMB was not significantly different between treatment-naive and relapsed SCLC samples (8.31/Mb [range: 1.50–16.87] vs. 8.37/Mb [range: 1.38–14.04]; p = 0.93, unpaired t- test).
473	6141466	BODY3	RESULTS	34	As expected, a single tumor sample obtained from a never-smoker (SCLC17), demonstrated a much lower mutational burden (1.40/Mb in chemotherapy-naive and 1.50/Mb in relapsed samples, respectively).
474	6141466	BODY3	RESULTS	35	Tumor samples obtained from all patients with a history of smoking were enriched for C > A||G > T transversions, and the samples from SCLC17 contained a lower proportion of C > A transversions.
475	6141466	BODY3	RESULTS	36	A comparison of the mutation patterns between relapse and treatment-naive samples by deconstructSigs10 failed to show an enrichment for the pancreatic platinum-response-associated mutation signature in relapse samples (signature 3, Supplementary fig. 1), possibly owing to the similarity in context between smoking and platinum-associated mutation signatures11, and to the overwhelming proportion of smoking-associated mutations across our samples.
476	6141466	BODY3	RESULTS	37	Consistent with previous observations made from genomes of irradiated tumors, relapse SCLC samples obtained from patients with limited stage SCLC who were treated with radiation (N = 14) were enriched for indels when compared to samples that were not irradiated (N = 16; p = 3.67e−13, unpaired t- test)12.
477	6141466	BODY3	RESULTS	38	For two individuals, metastatic sites were sectioned and sequenced, indicating little spatial heterogeneity in mutations within a metastatic site; however, distinct subsets of mutations were identified in samples collected from different metastatic sites within the same patient (Supplementary fig. 2).
478	6141466	BODY4	RESULTS	39	We observed TP53 and RB1 mutations in the majority of treatment-naive (TP53 in 11 of 12, RB1 in 10 of 12 patients) and relapse samples (TP53 in 29 of 30, RB1 in 21 of 30 patients).
479	6141466	BODY4	RESULTS	40	Loss of heterozygosity (LoH) of TP53 was observed in the one sample lacking a detectable TP53 mutation, and RB1 LoH was observed in seven of nine samples where no RB1 mutations were detected.
480	6141466	BODY4	RESULTS	41	These results are concordant with previous findings that RB1 is likely altered by intronic, epigenetic or large structural rearrangements that are not identifiable by WES in the remaining two treatment-naive samples.
481	6141466	BODY4	RESULTS	42	Together, 100% and 93% of relapse SCLC samples showed a mutation or LoH in TP53 and RB1 respectively, indicating that alterations in these genes are a characteristic feature of relapsed disease, similar to prior observations of their prevalence in primary SCLCs3.
482	6141466	BODY4	RESULTS	43	Including TP53 and RB1, a total of 30 genes were mutated at a statistically significant level using MuSiC13 (FDR CT, Q < 0.1) when evaluating only relapse SCLC samples (Fig. 1)13,14.
483	6141466	BODY4	RESULTS	44	COL11A1 (Q = 8.06e−07, Supplementary table 3), which codes for the alpha I chain of type XI collagen, was the most significantly mutated gene (SMG) after TP53 and RB1.
484	6141466	BODY4	RESULTS	45	COL11A1 is an important component of the extracellular matrix and its dysregulation has been shown to mediate resistance to platinum chemotherapy15.

493	6141466	BODY6	RESULTS	54	We also observed multiple recurrent somatic copy number alterations in relapsed SCLCs by GISTIC analysis (Q < 0.1) (Supplementary table 4)16, some of which are likely to play a crucial role in mediating chemotherapy resistance.
494	6141466	BODY6	RESULTS	55	Among these was ABCC1 (N = 7), also known as MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), an ATP-binding cassette membrane protein that transports physiologic substrates and drugs out of the cytoplasm17.
495	6141466	BODY6	RESULTS	56	ABCC1 mRNA was first isolated from a multi-drug resistant SCLC cell line (H69-AR), where it is upregulated through amplification18.
496	6141466	BODY6	RESULTS	57	We also observed deletions in mismatch repair (MMR) genes MSH2 (N = 5) and MSH6 (N = 5) at a significant level in relapse samples.
497	6141466	BODY6	RESULTS	58	Treatment-naive samples in our analysis did not show either of these copy number alterations at a significant level.
498	6141466	BODY6	RESULTS	59	Additionally, MSH6 mutations were observed only in relapse SCLC samples (N = 3), and none of the treatment-naive samples in our cohort.
499	6141466	BODY6	RESULTS	60	These observations are concordant with previously reported associations between MMR deficiency and cisplatin resistance in ovarian and colon cancer cell lines19.
500	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	61	In addition to our relapsed mutational landscape analysis, we also compared non-synonymous mutation data between patient matched treatment-naive and relapsed sample pairs to identify relapse-acquired mutations.
501	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	62	The high background mutation rate of SCLC and limited number of patient-matched paired samples, however, restricted our ability to statistically identify relapse-acquired mutations of interest.
502	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	63	We therefore adopted a knowledge-based approach to identify genes of interest.
503	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	64	We observed a total of 938 relapse-acquired mutations in 882 genes across the twelve paired samples.
504	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	65	From these 882 genes, 603 were altered in relapse samples and none of the treatment-naive samples (Supplementary table 5).
505	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	66	We then stringently filtered our list of 603 genes to only include genes with a known or predicted role in cancer.
506	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	67	For this purpose, we utilized a list of 114 genes that were mutated at a statistically significant level across 21 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer analysis (Supplementary table 6)20.
507	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	68	Our filtering resulted in the nomination of seven genes—CHD8, APC, DDX3X, MBD1, RHOA, RUNX1, and SMARCA4 as candidates for further analysis.
508	6141466	BODY7	RESULTS	69	Among these, recurrent mutations were observed in CHD8 (N = 6 of 30 patients), APC (N = 4), MBD1 (N = 3), and DDX3X (N = 2).
509	6141466	BODY8	RESULTS	70	Due to the striking similarity of the mutational landscape of primary and relapsed SCLCs, we investigated the role of transcriptional changes that may account for acquired chemotherapy resistance.
510	6141466	BODY8	RESULTS	71	SCLC is a neuroendocrine malignancy with demonstrated dysregulation of neuroendocrine lineage survival factors such as ASCL1 and NEUROD15,6.
511	6141466	BODY8	RESULTS	72	Previous studies of treatment-naive SCLC samples indicated that the majority of these tumors belong to a subtype that overexpresses ASCL1.
512	6141466	BODY8	RESULTS	73	ASCL1-high cell lines and murine tumors are typically enriched for MYCL amplifications or overexpression5,6.
513	6141466	BODY8	RESULTS	74	Contrary to what has been observed in treatment-naive SCLCs, we observed deletions encompassing MYCL (N = 4) at a statistically significant level in relapsed SCLC samples (Q < 0.1; Supplementary table 4).
514	6141466	BODY8	RESULTS	75	Additionally, RNA-sequencing data showed a higher than expected proportion6 of ASCL1-low tumors (50% vs. 18%; p = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) in our cohort of relapsed SCLC samples (Fig. 2a).

522	6141466	BODY8	RESULTS	83	Color scale for a increases from blue (low relative expression) to red (high relative expression)
523	6141466	BODY10	RESULTS	84	We utilized previously published RNA-sequencing data from 80 treatment-naive SCLC samples3 to compare their expression profiles to our relapse SCLC samples using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method21.
524	6141466	BODY10	RESULTS	85	Acknowledging the caveat that any observed differences could be due to a combination of true biological differences and batch effects across studies, we compared ASCL1-driven gene expression (defined by Borromeo et al.5) enrichment scores between the 80 treatment-naive and 18 relapsed SCLC samples.
525	6141466	BODY10	RESULTS	86	This showed significantly lower ssGSEA scores for ASCL1-driven gene expression among relapse samples (p < 0.05, unpaired t- test) (Fig. 2b).
526	6141466	BODY11	RESULTS	87	To test this at the protein level, we obtained an independent set of 12 pre-treatment and 10 post-treatment human SCLC samples from patients who received standard platinum chemotherapy.
527	6141466	BODY11	RESULTS	88	Immunohistochemistry for ASCL1 revealed a significant reduction in ASCL1-positive (ASCL1+) samples post-treatment (from 6 of 12 ASCL1+ pre-treatment to 0 of 10 ASCL1+ post treatment, p = 0.0152, Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 3a, b).
528	6141466	BODY11	RESULTS	89	Consistent with these data, both MYCL and ASCL1 were downregulated in two independent matched pairs of chemotherapy sensitive and resistant human SCLC cell lines (Fig. 3c).
529	6141466	BODY11	RESULTS	90	Collectively, these findings suggest a link between non-neuroendocrine differentiation and chemotherapy resistance in SCLCs.
530	6141466	BODY11	RESULTS	91	This hypothesis is concordant with in vitro data from other studies that have shown an association between non-neuroendocrine differentiation and chemotherapy resistance in SCLC22,23.

538	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	99	Based on our observations that markers of non-neuroendocrine differentiation are linked to chemotherapy resistance, we hypothesized that chemotherapy resistance would be driven by one or more modulators of cellular differentiation.
539	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	100	Evaluating our previously identified relapse-acquired genes, we observed that mutations in APC and CHD8 were both mutually exclusive and present in nearly one third of relapse SCLC samples (N = 4, 6, respectively; Supplementary fig. 3).
540	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	101	APC, which is mutated in several cancers, is a well-established negative regulator of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and WNT signaling24.
541	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	102	Similarly, CHD8 inhibits CTNNB1-mediated transcription in the nucleus and is recurrently mutated in prostate and gastric cancers25–28.
542	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	103	Due to the role of WNT signaling in cellular differentiation and in driving treatment resistance in other cancers, we hypothesized that this pathway may play an important role in the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance in relapsed SCLC29–33.
543	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	104	To evaluate this, we examined our data for mutations in other genes of the CTNNB1-mediated (canonical) WNT signaling pathway (Online Methods; Supplementary table 7).
544	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	105	This analysis revealed relapse-acquired mutations in additional genes regulating canonical WNT signaling such as CSNK1A1, HECW1, KMT2D, TLE2, TLE3, WNT1, and YWHAZ (Supplementary fig. 3).
545	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	106	Overall, relapse SCLC samples from 24 of 30 patients (80%) contained non-synonymous mutations in genes belonging to canonical WNT signaling that were unaltered in treatment-naive samples, with 6 of 12 (50%) paired samples exhibiting at least one relapse-acquired non-synonymous mutation in this pathway.
546	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	107	We also observed highly recurrent LoH in the WNT signaling genes APC (N = 19; 63% of cohort), CSNK1A1 (N = 20; 67%), and PSMD6 (N = 25; 83%).
547	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	108	Based upon these observations, we hypothesized that the level of canonical WNT pathway activation would be significantly higher among relapsed SCLC samples when compared to treatment-naive samples.
548	6141466	BODY13	RESULTS	109	We found that WNT pathway activation (as defined by gene expression signatures from two independent studies34,35) showed significantly higher ssGSEA enrichment scores for canonical WNT pathway activity in relapse SCLC samples compared to primary, treatment-naive samples (p < 0.0001 for each signature, unpaired t- test; Fig. 2c, d).
549	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	110	We then performed in vitro analyses to test the hypothesis that WNT activation drives chemotherapy resistance in SCLC by using APC knockdown as a model for WNT activation.
550	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	111	Stable APC knockdown through lentiviral delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the NCI-H1694 cell line (chemotherapy sensitive with wildtype APC), led to the activation of canonical WNT signaling and made these cells highly resistant to etoposide (Fig. 4a–c) and—to a lesser degree—cisplatin (Supplementary fig. 4a, b).
551	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	112	Additionally, these cells could be re-sensitized to chemotherapy following overexpression of a wildtype APC construct lacking untranslated regions (UTRs), in cells stably transfected with a knockdown shRNA construct targeting the 3′ UTR (construct shAPC#2; Fig. 4c and Supplementary fig. 4c).
552	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	113	We were also able to induce etoposide resistance and activation of WNT signaling through CRISPR–Cas9-guided deletion of APC in a different SCLC cell line, H82 (NCI-H82) (Fig. 4d–f).
553	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	114	The extent to which these cells became etoposide resistant was modest in comparison to H1694 cells with APC knockdown, with a 4.3-fold increase in IC50 (Fig. 4f).
554	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	115	Next, to determine the role of APC and WNT signaling in the setting of acquired chemotherapy resistance in vitro, we measured WNT activity in human SCLC cell lines DMS53 and NCI-H1048 and their chemotherapy resistant variants derived in culture.
555	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	116	Chemotherapy resistant variants of both cell lines showed evidence of increased WNT activity when compared to their chemotherapy sensitive counterparts based on increased levels of CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF (TOPFlash) WNT reporter activity (Supplementary fig. 5).
556	6141466	BODY14	RESULTS	117	Furthermore, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of global transcriptomic changes in these matched chemotherapy-sensitive and resistant pairs identified CTNNB1 as a top predicted upstream regulator in resistant samples (p = 2.35e−23 and 2.45e−18 for DMS53 and NCI-H1048, respectively, right-tailed Fisher’s exact test).

573	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	134	Results from our study suggest that activation of canonical WNT signaling leads to chemotherapy resistance in SCLC—a finding that has not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge.
574	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	135	WNT activation is likely to drive treatment resistance through its effects on apoptosis, DNA repair, expression of drug efflux pumps, cell differentiation, and/or by facilitating immune evasion30,31,36,37.
575	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	136	We noted alterations in multiple genes that participate in WNT signaling among relapsed tumors, independent of the presence of APC or CHD8 alterations.
576	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	137	Similar findings were reported for colorectal cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas, where tumors harboring APC mutations were also found to harbor other WNT pathway alterations38.
577	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	138	While the biological significance of cancer cells acquiring multiple alterations in the same pathway is unclear and may seem counterintuitive, it is possible that tumor cells select for these alterations to achieve an optimal level of WNT signaling39.
578	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	139	On the other hand, these alterations could be confined to different subclones within the tumor and represent various mechanisms through which cancer cells activate WNT signaling.
579	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	140	We also observed LoH in negative regulators of canonical WNT signaling such as APC and CSNK1A1 in nearly two-thirds of relapse SCLC samples.
580	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	141	In conjunction with the high ssGSEA scores for WNT activation among relapse samples, this observation demonstrates that WNT signaling genes are likely to be altered through mechanisms other than non-synonymous mutations, which WES alone is unable to detect.
581	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	142	Furthermore, components of the WNT signaling pathway are promiscuous in their interactions and demonstrate a great degree of overlap with other pathways.
582	6141466	BODY16	CONCLUSIONS	143	Therefore, molecular studies of how alterations in WNT signaling affect the net activation of different pathways and a comprehensive analysis of the clonal architecture of tumors employing ultra-deep or single-cell sequencing techniques is likely to shed more light on the precise mechanisms of drug resistance in SCLC.
583	6141466	BODY17	CONCLUSIONS	144	A recent study reported by Gardner et al. utilizing human SCLC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) failed to observe mutational differences between treatment-naive and relapsed SCLCs40.
584	6141466	BODY17	CONCLUSIONS	145	EZH2-mediated epigenetic reprogramming that led to the silencing of SLFN11 was identified as the mechanism driving induced chemotherapy resistance in this study—a finding which we were unable to reproduce, possibly due to a lack of paired primary-relapse gene expression data.
585	6141466	BODY17	CONCLUSIONS	146	Interestingly, another recent analysis by Drapkin et al., reported an association between increased expression of a MYC gene signature and chemotherapy resistance in SCLC PDXs derived from biopsy samples and circulating tumor cells, but failed to observe a correlation between SLFN11 expression and chemotherapy sensitivity41.
586	6141466	BODY17	CONCLUSIONS	147	Heterogeneity in mechanisms that drive chemotherapy resistance in SCLC, sample characteristics, and differences in experimental design are likely factors contributing to the observed discrepancies between studies.
587	6141466	BODY17	CONCLUSIONS	148	For instance, since chemotherapy is known to affect immunogenic cell death in cancer cells and WNT signaling plays an important role in shaping tumor-host immune interactions, the utilization of immunodeficient mice for generating PDXs could have influenced the selection pressures acting on grafted tumors following exposure to chemotherapy in these studies31,42.
588	6141466	BODY18	CONCLUSIONS	149	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of paired human SCLC samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse.
589	6141466	BODY18	CONCLUSIONS	150	We acknowledge the limitations of our study, particularly with regard to small sample size, limited number of matched treatment-naive samples, and lack of RNA-sequencing data from treatment-naive samples.
590	6141466	BODY18	CONCLUSIONS	151	While these factors limit our ability to perform a number of additional informative analyses (e.g., tumor/relapse paired CTNNB1 immunohistochemistry), it is extremely important to consider that patients with relapsed SCLC rarely undergo biopsies that yield enough tissue for high throughput sequencing. Our ability to demonstrate WNT pathway mutations and activation in relapse SCLC samples, and to validate their role in mediating chemotherapy resistance in vitro provide a rationale for studying WNT signaling inhibitors to overcome treatment resistance in SCLC.
591	6141466	BODY19	METHODS	152	Tumor specimens for whole exome and transcriptome sequencing were obtained from patients diagnosed with SCLC who were treated at the Alvin J Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine.

609	6141466	BODY22	METHODS	170	All genomic analyses were managed with the Genome Modeling System (GMS)43. Exome sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome build GRCh37 using bwamem version 0.7.10 with default parameters44.
610	6141466	BODY22	METHODS	171	Exome alignment models were processed by the GMS Somatic variation pipeline to identify single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (indels), and copy number alterations (CNAs)43. The union of snv/indel variant calls for each sample were manually reviewed using IGV45 (Supplementary table 10).
611	6141466	BODY22	METHODS	172	Somatic SNV detection was performed in this pipeline using a combination of SomaticSniper (version 1.0.2)46, VarScan (version 2.3.6)47, and Strelka (1.0.11)48.
612	6141466	BODY22	METHODS	173	Somatic small indels were detected by a combination of GATK Somatic Indel Detector (version 5336)49, Pindel (version 0.5)50, VarScan, and Strelka.
613	6141466	BODY22	METHODS	174	Annotation of variants was performed using the GMS transcript variant annotator against a GMS “annotation” build based on Ensembl v74_37 transcripts.
614	6141466	BODY22	METHODS	175	SNVs and INDELs were further filtered by removing artifacts found in a panel of 905 normal exomes51, removing sites that exceeded 0.1% frequency in the ExAC cohort release v0.252, and then using a bayesian classifier (https://github.com/genome/genome/blob/master/lib/perl/Genome/Model/Tools/Validation/IdentifyOutliers.pm) and retaining variants classified as somatic with a binomial log-likelihood of at least 10 (params: -llr-cutoff 10).
615	6141466	BODY22	METHODS	176	Finally, these filtered mutations then underwent manual review with IGV.

621	6141466	BODY25	METHODS	182	SMGs in relapsed samples were identified using MuSiC v0.413.
622	6141466	BODY25	METHODS	183	The region of interest file was created using regions annotated as CDS or RNA in Ensembl v74 with 2 bp flank added to contiguous exons in order to retain splice sites.
623	6141466	BODY25	METHODS	184	Only relapse and normal samples were used for analysis.
624	6141466	BODY25	METHODS	185	For individuals with multiple relapse samples, variants from all relapse samples for that individual were merged, deduplicated and used for analysis.
625	6141466	BODY25	METHODS	186	A representative BAM file was also used for coverage calculations for these individuals.
626	6141466	BODY25	METHODS	187	The “-merge-concurrent-muts” option was applied, allowing a single individual to only contribute, at most, a single mutation to the total mutation burden of any one gene.
627	6141466	BODY25	METHODS	188	All other default parameters were used.

634	6141466	BODY26	METHODS	195	Output file significant calls were verified by manual review using original BAM files in IGV.
635	6141466	BODY27	METHODS	196	Heterozygous germline variant calls were selected from each patient sample where the normal VAF was within the range of 40–60.

637	6141466	BODY27	METHODS	198	Segments were generated using the DNAcopy54 circular binary segmentation algorithm, and average zygosity score of constituent variants attributed to the segments.
638	6141466	BODY27	METHODS	199	Biomart55 was used to obtain genomic coordinates for each gene and overlap with the segment coordinates, to generate a zygosity score for each gene in each sample.
639	6141466	BODY27	METHODS	200	A zygosity score above 30 (representing an average tumor VAF < 20 or >80) was used to call a gene as loss-of-heterozygosity (LoH) (Supplementary table 11).
640	6141466	BODY27	METHODS	201	In cases where there was insufficient data to make a segment, the zygosity score was omitted, and no LoH call was made.
641	6141466	BODY28	METHODS	202	Cancer relevant genes were collected from Supplementary table 2 of Lawrence et al., and filtered for a pan-cancer q value < = 0.1, as discussed in the main text of that paper (list of genes available in Supplementary table 6).

643	6141466	BODY29	METHODS	204	Fasta files were trimmed using Flexbar56 with settings: -adapter-min-overlap 7 -min-read-length 20 to improve read alignments.
644	6141466	BODY29	METHODS	205	Reads were aligned by hisat2.0.557 using Ensembl version 74 transcripts.
645	6141466	BODY29	METHODS	206	Reads were sorted and indexed by SAMtools 1.3.158 and then used for expression estimation by Stringtie 1.3.359.
646	6141466	BODY30	METHODS	207	Stringtie expression estimates were loaded by Ballgown60, expression filtered, log transformed, normalized by ComBat61, and clustered with pheatmap (https://github.com/raivokolde/pheatmap) in an ad hoc script available on the methods repository for this manuscript (https://github.com/ahwagner/sclc).

653	6141466	BODY33	METHODS	214	Subtype information for George et al. treatment-naive samples was obtained from the publication by Mollaoglu et al.6 Finally, independently categorized samples were grouped together by subtype for this analysis, to test the ability of ssGSEA to detect true biological differences independent of batch effect.
654	6141466	BODY33	METHODS	215	As expected, ASCL1 high tumors from both studies were most enriched for the ASCL1 signature, while dual negatives were the least enriched (one-way ANOVA analysis; p < 0.0001).
655	6141466	BODY33	METHODS	216	Similarly, analyses by Mollaoglu et al. and Polley et al. demonstrated high MYC activity in ASCL1-low SCLC samples and cell lines6,62.
656	6141466	BODY33	METHODS	217	Using the ssGSEA method, we calculated enrichment scores for MYC activation (using the MYC activation signature defined by Bild et al.) and ASCL1 driven gene expression (defined by Borromeo et al.) and examined their correlation5,62.
657	6141466	BODY33	METHODS	218	Once again, independently subtyped SCLC samples were grouped together for this analysis.
658	6141466	BODY33	METHODS	219	As expected, MYC activation was inversely correlated with high ASCL1 enrichment scores (linear regression; p = 0.003).

753	5589900	TITLE	TITLE	0	Copy number rather than epigenetic alterations are the major dictator of imprinted methylation in tumors
754	5589900	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	It has been postulated that imprinting aberrations are common in tumors.
755	5589900	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	To understand the role of imprinting in cancer, we have characterized copy-number and methylation in over 280 cancer cell lines and confirm our observations in primary tumors.
756	5589900	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	Imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) regulate parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of neighboring transcripts in cis.
757	5589900	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Unlike single-copy CpG islands that may be prone to hypermethylation, imprinted DMRs can either loose or gain methylation during tumorigenesis.
758	5589900	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	Here, we show that methylation profiles at imprinted DMRs often not represent genuine epigenetic changes but simply the accumulation of underlying copy-number aberrations (CNAs), which is independent of the genome methylation state inferred from cancer susceptible loci.
759	5589900	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	Our results reveal that CNAs also influence allelic expression as loci with copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity or amplifications may be expressed from the appropriate parental chromosomes, which is indicative of maintained imprinting, although not observed as a single expression foci by RNA FISH.
760	5589900	ABS1	ABSTRACT	7	Altered genomic imprinting is frequently reported in cancer.
761	5589900	ABS1	ABSTRACT	8	Here, the authors analyze copy number and methylation in cancer cell lines and primary tumors to show that imprinted methylation profiles represent the accumulation of copy number alteration, rather than epigenetic alterations.
762	5589900	BODY0	BACKGROUND	9	Cancer is the leading cause of death in adults.
763	5589900	BODY0	BACKGROUND	10	Tumors themselves are typically classified using pathological criteria and tissue origin.
764	5589900	BODY0	BACKGROUND	11	However following the huge investment from large international consortia, cancers can now be sorted into molecular subgroups based on genetic and epigenetic profiles1 which has led to targeted therapies for subtypes with specific alterations.
765	5589900	BODY1	BACKGROUND	12	To help with molecular classification, we have investigated whether aberrations at imprinted loci can stratify tumors from different tissue origins.
766	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	13	Genomic imprinting is the parent-of-origin specific monoallelic transcription, regulated in part by allelic difference in DNA methylation established in the male and female germline and maintained throughout somatic development2.
767	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	14	In addition to being indispensible for growth, imprinted genes have been suggested to play a crucial role in driving oncogenic switch or suppressing tumor development3.
768	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	15	Deregulated expression, which includes the reactivation of the normally silent allele (commonly referred to as loss-of-imprinting, LOI) or the silencing of the transcribed allele, has been implicated in childhood cancer associated with the classical imprinting disorder Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome4.
769	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	16	In these cases gains of methylation at the paternally methylated H19 DMR or paternal uniparental disomy (copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity, cnnLOH) result in over-expression of IGF2-miR483 and the concomitant silencing of H19-miR6755.
770	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	17	However it is becoming evident that an increasingly number of imprinted genes shows irregularities in adult tumors.
771	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	18	For example aberrant expression of transcripts in the H19-IGF2 domain has been reported in more than 15 tumor types, with somatic amplifications of IGF2 and miR483 implicated in the initiation of colorectal cancer5, 6, with copy-number gains being mutually exclusive with P13K pathway-activating mutations7.
772	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	19	In addition over-expression of H19-miR675 is frequently observed in colorectal cancers, which suppress the expression of the tumor-suppressor RB1
773	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	20	8.
774	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	21	Downregulation of DIRAS3 (also known as ARH1) by either deletion or methylation is frequently observed in breast and ovarian cancers9, 10 and has been implicated in sensitivity to Cisplatin, a widely used platinum-based chemotherapy agent11.
775	5589900	BODY2	BACKGROUND	22	Furthermore epigenetic silencing and deletions of L3MBTL1, a member of the polycomb-like family located at chromosome 20q, is associated with hematological malignancies showing increased genome instability12, 13.
776	5589900	BODY3	BACKGROUND	23	Imprinted deregulation has also helped modify our thoughts on the classical genetic events leading to cancer.
777	5589900	BODY3	BACKGROUND	24	For example, despite the RB1 gene being at the center of Knudson’s two hit hypothesis in which familial retinoblastoma displays autosomal dominant inheritance with the first hit present in the germline and the second somatically acquired14, this gene is preferentially expressed from the maternal chromosome15.
778	5589900	BODY3	BACKGROUND	25	This is evident in epidemiological data from sporadic retinoblastoma patients in which the maternal chromosome 13 is preferentially lost16.
779	5589900	BODY4	BACKGROUND	26	Ignoring placenta-specific imprinted genes17–19, there are currently ~150 transcripts in the human genome mapping to ~30 domains suggesting that other imprinted genes may contribute to the development of cancer in adults.
780	5589900	BODY4	BACKGROUND	27	However to date very few studies have systematically looked at the influence of somatically acquired copy-number alterations (CNAs) on imprinted methylation profiles in cancer. We have performed an analysis to determine the association between CNAs and DNA methylation profiles for three cancer cell types originating in the lung, colon and breast which rank among the most frequent solid tumor types, as well as liver, which is a prevalent cause of cancer-associated deaths due to hepatitis B virus infections (https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics).
781	5589900	BODY4	BACKGROUND	28	Overall we observe that all four-tumor types show highly aberrant profiles, with a high proportion of aberrant imprinted DMR methylation patterns being associated with cancer-associated CNAs and not somatically acquired epigenetic defects.
782	5589900	BODY5	RESULTS	29	We utilize copy-number and epigenetic data from a large set of cancer cell lines from the Sanger Institutes COSMIC project20, 21 with observations confirmed in cohorts of well-characterized primary cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium7, 22–25.
783	5589900	BODY5	RESULTS	30	To determine the interplay between CNAs and DNA methylation we combined data from genotyping (Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP6 arrays) and methylation (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, HM450k) platforms that interrogated 906,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 485,577 CpG dinucleotides, respectively.
784	5589900	BODY5	RESULTS	31	Our group has previously characterized the Infinium HM450k methylation array for parent-of-origin methylation associated with imprinted regions17.
785	5589900	BODY5	RESULTS	32	In this study we focused on the 661 probes mapping to 37 imprinted DMRs.
786	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	33	High-resolution copy-number data for each imprinted domain was obtained from COSMIC cell line project that included 173 lung, 50 colorectal, 49 breast and 15 hepatocarcinoma cell lines.
787	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	34	We confirmed the CNAs using other low-resolution molecular cytogenetic methods, including SKY karyotyping and standard DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Fig. 1a–c)(http://www.pawefish.path.cam.ac.uk)25.
788	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	35	We identify thousands of aberrations including deletions, amplifications and cnnLOH.
789	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	36	Copy-number calling was reported as total copy number and minor allele, where a normal diploid state is 2:1 and cnnLOH having a total copy number ≥ 2 and a minor allele count of zero, an event in which one allele is deleted and the remaining one amplified.
790	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	37	In all cases an estimated ploidy baseline (total alleles/baseline ploidy) was also calculated for each cell line (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Figs 1–6) since total copy number ≥ 2 could represent amplification in a diploid tumor but a deletion in a hyperploid tumor.
791	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	38	No cell lines had normal copy-number at all imprinted domains, with the least affected being the breast-derived CAL-51 cell line that was normal except for cnnLOH of the chromosome 11q15 domains (2:0) and the colorectal cell line LS-180 which had isolated cnnLOH of GRB10 (2:0).
792	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	39	The most severe CNAs were observed in lung cancer cell lines, with the PPIEL locus on chromosome 1 being amplified up to 14 times in DMS-273 (14:1) NCI-H378 (14:1) and NCI-H1836 (14:2) with the NCI-H1694 cell line having all copies of one allele (14:0).
793	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	40	Such huge gains were not restricted to the PPIEL locus as the MCTS2/HM13 domain was also amplified 14 times in the SKLU-1 cell line (14:2).
794	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	41	The full catalog of copy-number and methylation results is available at www.humanimprints.net (Supplementary Data 2).

803	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	50	The colorectal cell line HCT-15 has normal copy-number, whereas the two breast cancer cell lines carry CNAs.
804	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	51	The HCC1954 cells have a focal amplification of SNRPN while the amplification in the T47D cells incorporates the centromere.

810	5589900	BODY6	RESULTS	57	Data points outside this range are deemed to have a methylation profile independent of CNA
811	5589900	BODY8	RESULTS	58	Next, we wish to determine the size of the CNAs since telomere/centromere bound aberrations tend to be larger than focal internal CNAs24.
812	5589900	BODY8	RESULTS	59	Indeed we observe that focal internal CNAs incorporating imprinted domains were smaller in 96% of cases and were in higher copy number 79% of the time.
813	5589900	BODY8	RESULTS	60	For example the average telomere bound amplification for HTR5A on chromosome 7 is 41 Mb, with an average total copy-number of 4.4, whereas internal amplifications are on average 8.5 Mb with >9 copies (Supplementary Data 3).
814	5589900	BODY8	RESULTS	61	For chromosomes harboring more than one imprinted domain, the CNAs may be focal or involve the entire chromosome arm (Fig. 1c, d)(extended data available at the www.humanimprints.net).
815	5589900	BODY8	RESULTS	62	This was confirmed using DNA FISH in the breast cancer cell line HCC1954 that has an internal amplification of 15q11.2-12 including SNRPN that does not encompass the nearby centromere (Fig. 1c).
816	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	63	We hypothesize that CNAs are a major determinant of allelic methylation at imprinted DMRs.
817	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	64	To ensure that the profiles obtained using the COSMIC HM450k methylation data set accurately reflected the methylation pattern at imprinted DMRs, we compared the profiles for five cell lines with those obtained using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) generated by ENCODE.
818	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	65	Despite the difference in technology, a comparison of the methylation profiles revealed high correlation (Spearman ‘s correlation: A549 r = 0.85, HCT-116 r = 0.79, T47D r = 0.95, HepG2 r = 0.6, MCF7 r = 0.74. P-value < 0.0001) suggesting that the HM450k methylation array data can be used with high confidence (Supplementary Fig. 7).
819	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	66	To test our hypothesis, we subsequently compared the absolute methylation (average methylation for all probes within an imprinted DMR) with the CNA-based predicted methylation value.
820	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	67	Assuming that no epimutations have occurred, then methylation will be entirely dictated by chromosome number and parental origin.
821	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	68	For example for a normal cell with 2:1 copy-number complement, methylation will be ~ 50% as one allele is methylated and the other unmethylated.
822	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	69	However for a cell line of 4:1, depending on the parental origin of the minor allele methylation will be in a ratio of 75:25 or 25:75%.
823	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	70	In all cases of cnnLOH the methylation profile will be near zero or fully methylated irrespective of the total chromosome number.
824	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	71	Any sample with a CNA-based predicted methylation value outside ± 3 s.d.
825	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	72	of normal tissue controls were assumed to have a profile not dependent on CNA, and attributed to a failure to maintain the correct epigenetic profile (Fig. 1e).
826	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	73	In total 17.6% of all imprinted DMRs in breast-derived cancer cell lines present with methylation changes independent of CNA, whereas only 12.8% lung, 9% liver and 8.1% colon cancer cell posses methylation profiles not corresponding to copy-number.
827	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	74	An estimate of the proportion of methylation variability explained by copy-number alone is shown in the supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. 8).
828	5589900	BODY9	RESULTS	75	The most frequently epimutated regions varied depending on tissue origin, with the maternally methylated ZNF597 DMR being affected in 66.6% of hepatocarcinoma cell lines, H19 in 28.9 % of lung, ZNF331 DMR1 in 32% of colon and GRB10 in 44.9% of breast-derived cancer cell lines.
829	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	76	To obtain a clearer picture of the role of aberrant methylation independent of CNAs, we assessed the allelic methylation asymmetry at imprinted domains in cancer cell lines without copy-number changes.
830	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	77	A comparison of the distribution of Infinium HM450k β-values revealed that copy-number normal samples were more frequently hypermethylated rather than failing to maintain methylation, a pattern that was not obvious when all cell lines were analyzed together irrespective of CNAs (Fig. 2a).
831	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	78	To confirm the high-density array methylation profiles we performed pyrosequencing for 3 DMRs including NHP2L1, FAM50B and the KvDMR1 (Fig. 2b).
832	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	79	The results obtained were extremely similar for the two different methodologies (Spearman’s correlation; NHP2L1 r = 0.88, FAM50B r = 0.97, KvDMR1 r = 0.88), further reassuring us that the array-based methylation profiling is extremely accurate.
833	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	80	However, despite being quantitative, pyrosequencing does not give strand-specific or allelic information and averaging β-values for all probes within an imprinted DMR may mask subtle anomalies.
834	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	81	For these reasons, we performed bisulphite PCRs and subcloning to confirm some of the rare unexpected array methylation profiles (Fig. 2c).
835	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	82	For example we observe complete hypermethylation at the PLAGL1 DMR in the colorectal cell line SW48 but two different profiles in SW837, with the 5′ promoter region being fully methylated whilst the interval encompassing the transcription start site (TSS) has normal allelic methylation.
836	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	83	A similar bipartite methylation profile was also observed at the MEG3 DMR in the hepatocarcinoma cell line JHH-4.
837	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	84	In addition we observe normal allelic methylation of the L3MBTL1 DMR in breast cancer cell line T47D, with the exception that the ~ 200 bp immediately adjacent to the TSS, which is devoid of methylation.
838	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	85	We previously described that the bidirectional promoter associated with the SGCE and PEG10 is a maternal DMR on the telomeric side of a large CpG island, with the opposite side unmethylated in all somatic tissues, except placenta where is also methylated on the maternal allele17.
839	5589900	BODY10	RESULTS	86	Intriguingly we observe that several cell lines, irrespectively of tissue origin, adopt this placenta profile, which we confirm by PCR in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (Fig. 2c).

854	5589900	BODY12	RESULTS	101	The effect of non-imprinted genes located within the same CNAs as imprinted loci could influence tumor development.
855	5589900	BODY12	RESULTS	102	In an attempt to understand the impact of additional genes, we identified nine oncogenes and two tumor-suppressor genes that map within the vicinity of the imprinted loci (Supplementary Data 4).
856	5589900	BODY12	RESULTS	103	In general, the greater the distance between the cancer-associated gene and the imprinted loci the lower the frequency that both regions are involved in the same cytogenetic aberration.
857	5589900	BODY12	RESULTS	104	However, in many cases both loci are affected.
858	5589900	BODY12	RESULTS	105	For example, the imprinted PPIEL locus is located ~373 kb from the MYCL1 oncogene and co-amplification of both regions was observed in 98% of lung, 91% in liver, 97% in breast and 100% in colon cancer cell lines harboring copy-number gains of 1p34.
859	5589900	BODY13	RESULTS	106	In addition to the classic acquired LOH caused with deletions, we show that cnnLOH is a common chromosomal defect affecting imprinted loci.
860	5589900	BODY13	RESULTS	107	Since cnnLOH may lead to homozygosity of pathogenic mutations (i.e., silencing tumor-suppressor genes or activating oncogenes) we screened for genes with homozygous mutations mapping within cnnLOH regions harboring imprinted loci.
861	5589900	BODY13	RESULTS	108	Of the 280 cell lines analyzed, 258 had at least one region of cnnLOH affecting an imprinted loci with 26% also containing homozygous mutated genes described from in the COSMIC database. The majority of mutated genes have not been associated with tumor initiation of progression.
862	5589900	BODY13	RESULTS	109	However we did identify reoccurring mutations of RB1 associated with cnnLOH of chr13q14 and PTEN mutations with cnnLOH of chr10q23-26 in lung and breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Data 5).
863	5589900	BODY14	RESULTS	110	Further analysis of the parent-of-origin of the cnnLOH, as inferred by the methylation profile of the affected imprinted DMRs, suggests that the influence on imprinted gene dosage is complex.
864	5589900	BODY14	RESULTS	111	For example, cnnLOH for the chr11p15.5 interval involves both the maternally and paternally derived chromosomes equally in breast and lung cancer-derived cell lines, but is exclusively paternal in colon cancer cell lines consistent with previous observations that IGF2 over-expression is oncogenic7.
865	5589900	BODY14	RESULTS	112	For cases also harboring homozygous mutated genes, it seems that the presence of the genetic variant is more influential than the parent-of-origin of the cnnLOH, with the exception that RB1, in which all lung cancer cell lines (7/7) are associated with hypermethylation at the RB1 imprinted DMR.
866	5589900	BODY15	RESULTS	113	Compared to normal cells, cancer cells show drastic changes in DNA methylation status, generally exhibiting global hypomethylation at intragenic and repetitive elements accompanied by regions of hypermethylation.
867	5589900	BODY15	RESULTS	114	Over the years the various regions of cancer-associated hypermethylation have been defined, initially as a collective of promoter CpG islands prone to gaining methylation known as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)26.
868	5589900	BODY15	RESULTS	115	The list of hypermethylated regions is continually expanding with use of technologies with increased genome resolution and now include bivalent domains, CpG-rich sequences decorated with the permissive histone modification H3K4me2/3 and the repressive modification H3K27me3, which represent ~68% of cancer-associated hypermethylated genes27, 28 and DNA methylation valleys (DMVs), large intervals that are generally devoid of DNA methylation in normal tissues29 (Supplementary Data 6).
869	5589900	BODY15	RESULTS	116	We compared the DNA methylation profiles of 30 CIMP, 442 bivalent domains and 166 DMVs to obtain a general genome methylation profile in each cancer cell line. We observe that cell lines with the greatest number of hypermethylated CIMP regions were also more susceptible to bivalent and DMV hypermethylation (Fig. 3a).
870	5589900	BODY15	RESULTS	117	To determine if the predominant hypermethylation we observe at imprinted DMRs simply reflects the genome-wide methylation state, we ordered each cell line according to its CIMP profile (i.e., ranked according to the severity and number of affected loci per cell line).
871	5589900	BODY15	RESULTS	118	Unlike CIMP and bivalent domains that are highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation: colon r = 0.96. Spearman’s correlation: breast r = 0.93, liver r = 0.92 and lung r = 0.93) there was no apparent similarity between CIMP and imprinted methylation for any cancer type (Fig. 3b).Fig.

878	5589900	BODY15	RESULTS	125	For each type of loci the number of genes analyzed is indicated on the x-axis
879	5589900	BODY17	RESULTS	126	In addition, we assessed a subset of cancer cell lines for hypomethylation of repetitive DNA (ALU-Yb8, LINE-1 and α-satellites).
880	5589900	BODY17	RESULTS	127	These elements are commonly used as surrogates to measure genome-wide methylation levels as ~ 27% of total CpG methylation is contained within LINE-1 elements and 23% in ALU-Yb8 sequences30.
881	5589900	BODY17	RESULTS	128	We identified substantial hypomethylation of these elements in numerous cell lines compared to tissue matched controls, but those cell lines affected did not show extreme hyper- or hypomethylation at imprinted DMR (Supplementary Fig. 9).
882	5589900	BODY17	RESULTS	129	Taken together these observations argue against a direct connection between global DNA methylation status and imprinting, supporting an independent mechanism of regulation in cancer.
883	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	130	To date, very few cancer cell lines have been assessed for allelic expression of imprinted genes.
884	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	131	To determine the influence of both methylation and CNAs on allelic expression, we genotyped highly informative exonic SNPs within NAPL1L5, PEG10, H19, IGF2, MEST, KCNQ1OT1, MEG3, PEG3, L3MBTL1 and NHP2L1 in 57 cancer cell lines with allelic expression determined by PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) in heterozygous cases (Supplementary Figs 10–19).
885	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	132	This revealed that if expressed, copy-number normal cell lines with normal methylation maintained appropriate monoallelic expression (e.g., NHP2L1 in NCI-H441; KCNQ1OT1 in COLO-824, DM-273, HCT-15, NCI-H1048 and MDA-MB-157; MEG3 in Hs-578-T; NAP1L5 in BT-474, GP5d and HCT-15; PEG10 in HCT-116) and in rare cases with robust loss-of-methylation the transcripts were biallelically expressed (e.g., NHP2L1 in HLE).
886	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	133	Interestingly we observe several cases in which cell lines with a total/minor ratio of 4:2 with ~50% methylation are also robustly expressed from one genotype, suggesting that the four chromosomes are maintaining their original parental imprints having two active and two repressed chromosome copies (e.g., NHP2L1 in Hs-578-T and NCI-H508, KCNQ1OT1 in AU565 and HCC1954; H19 in LS-411N and LS-1034; L3MBTL1 in NCI-H1975; NAP1L5 in MDA-MB-453).
887	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	134	To confirm these expression profiles, we performed RNA FISH for the long non-coding (lnc)RNA KCNQ1OT1 that is retained near the site of transcription.
888	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	135	In the breast cell line COLO-824, we observe a single signal consistent with it being copy-number normal and monoallelically expressed, as did the colorectal cell lines HCT-15, confirming the observations by Sunamura et al.31 (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 20).
889	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	136	We observe two signals in the MCF7 cell line that has cnnLOH for 11p15 (total/minor ratio of 2:0) and absence of methylation at the KvDMR1.
890	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	137	Interestingly we also observe two KCNQ1OT1 signals in the copy-number 4:2 HCC1954 cell line consistent with two copies of the paternal allele being expressed in these cells.
891	5589900	BODY18	RESULTS	138	These observations highlight that fact that a cell may be transcribing from more than one chromosome but maintaining the correct imprinting profile if it carries copy-number aberrations.

900	5589900	BODY20	RESULTS	147	Human cancer-derived cell lines are widely used models to study the biology of cancer and in the majority of cases recurrent genetic and epigenetic change found in tumors are also identified in cell lines and vice versa.
901	5589900	BODY20	RESULTS	148	In order to confirm our cell lines observations in primary tumors we analyzed publically available data sets from TCGA including breast carcinomas (BRCA), colon adenocarcinomas (COAD), liver hepatocellular carcinomas (LIHC) and lung tumors (lung adenocarcinomas, LUAD + squamous cell carcinomas, LUSC) for which data is available from normal, tumor and adjacent-tissue samples.
902	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	149	A huge number of CNAs were observed in the primary data sets encompassing imprinted domains, but in most cases copy-number gains were not as severe as in cell lines and were restricted to the tumor samples and not matched adjacent-tissue (Fig. 5a, b).
903	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	150	For many imprinted loci the copy-number aberrations were a mix of both deletions and amplifications, but striking recurrent changes were observed.
904	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	151	For example, the four imprinted regions on chromosome 20q (MCTS2, NNAT, L3MTBL1 and GNAS) were invariable subject to copy-number gains with very few deletions observed in the four cancer types.
905	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	152	In contrast some imprinted domain were associated with CNAs specific to a tumor type.
906	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	153	When observed, H19/IGF2 CNAs in COAD were mainly amplifications, consistent with previous reports7, whereas equal numbers of gains/losses are observed in the other three tumor types analyzed.
907	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	154	Furthermore, amplifications of RB1 at chr13q14 were preferentially observed in COAD samples whereas deletions were preferentially observed in BRCA, the latter consistent with the reports of the functional loss of RB1 in basal-like and luminal breast carcinomas32.
908	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	155	Similarly chromosome 22q deletions are common somatic alteration in both breast and colorectal cancer33 and we confirm a high frequency of deletions of NH2PL1 mapping to 22q13 in BRCA and COAD data sets.

925	5589900	BODY21	RESULTS	172	Data points outside this range are deemed to have a methylation profile independent of CNA
926	5589900	BODY23	RESULTS	173	Next, we wish to determine the size of the CNAs since we observed that telomere/centromere bound aberrations tend to be larger than focal internal CNAs in cancer cell lines.
927	5589900	BODY23	RESULTS	174	This was also true for CNAs encompassing imprinted domains in primary cancer samples, with focal internal CNAs being more prevalent and often in higher copy number than those involving either the telomere or centromere (extended data available at the www.humanimprints.net).
928	5589900	BODY23	RESULTS	175	For example the average telomere bound amplification for IGF1R on chromosome 15 is 18 Mb, often representing just a single additional copy, whereas internal amplifications are on average 3 Mb with 6–7 copies.
929	5589900	BODY24	RESULTS	176	The methylation changes in the TCGA primary tumor samples are less frequent and less extreme than in cancer cell lines; however, this may reflect cellular composition of the sample with primary tumors being heterogenous and infiltrated with normal cells (mean tumor cell estimate ± s.d. ; BRCA 72.2 ± 20.5%, COAD 71.5 ± 16.6%, LIHC 87.1 ± 11.7%, LUAD 76.3 ± 19.1%) (Supplementary Data 7).
930	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	177	There was high correlation between hypermethyalted CIMP, bivalent domains and DMVs for all tissues (Spearman’s correlation for CIMP vs bivalent domains: BRCA r = 0.88, COAD r = 0.95, LIHC r = 0.81 and LUAD r = 0.84)(Fig. 5c), with the COAD sample set being more hypermethyalted than the other cancer types (Supplementary Data 8).
931	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	178	With the exception of the LIHC samples, the number of imprinted DMRs subject to hypermethylation is much greater than those with hypomethylation (Fig. 5c, d), with no correlation with global DNA methylation status as gauged by comparisons with CIMP, bivalent domains and DMVs (Fig. 5c).
932	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	179	Consistent with our observation in cell lines, aberrant imprinted methylation was closely associated with CNAs status (Fig. 5e).
933	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	180	To determine whether specific imprinted DMRs were affected in cancer from different tissue origin, we assessed the frequency of methylation defects at loci with normal 2:1 copy-number.
934	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	181	No particular DMR was affected in specific cancer type.
935	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	182	The most frequently observed hypermethylated regions are PEG13 (60%) in COAD, PPIEL (34%) in LIHC, INPP5FV2 (30%) in BRCA and the paternally methylated ZNF597 DMR (20%) in LUAD.
936	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	183	Similarly, no imprinted DMR was consistently hypomethylated, with the most frequently affected regions being GNAS (20%) in LIHC, FAM50B (9%) in LUAD, L3MBTL1 (8%) in COAD and MCTS2 (6%) in BRCA.
937	5589900	BODY25	RESULTS	184	Furthermore some imprinted DMRs have stable methylation comparable with normal tissues with the LUAD data set having the most unaffected loci (NAP1L5, PLAGL1, PEG10, MEST, PEG3, NNAT and NH2PL1).
938	5589900	BODY26	RESULTS	185	The somatic load of driver mutations in the cancer cell lines has been extensive studied, with the results cataloged in the COSMIC somatic mutation database.
939	5589900	BODY26	RESULTS	186	To determine if methylation defects at imprinted loci were more prevalent in tumors harboring-specific genetic aberrations, we compare methylation profiles of samples with 2:1 copy-number positive for common mutations1.
940	5589900	BODY26	RESULTS	187	We failed to observe any association between reoccurring mutations (TP53, PIK3CA, CDH1 and AKT1 in breast-derive cancer cell lines; TP53, MLH1, APC, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA in colorectal cancer cell lines; CTNNB1, TP53, AXIN1, JAK1 and LRP1B in hepatocarcinoma cell lines; TP53, PIK3CA and AKT1 in lung cancer cell lines) or microsatellite instability (MSI) and imprinted DMR status for any cell lines.
941	5589900	BODY26	RESULTS	188	However we observe increased normal copy-number status in colon, liver and lung-derived cell lines with high MSI, consistent with the previous reports that chromosomal instability and microsatellite stability are largely mutually exclusive34 (Supplementary Figs 21–24).
942	5589900	BODY27	RESULTS	189	The primary tumor samples from the TCGA have also been extensive studied at the molecular level allowing similar comparisons to be performed.
943	5589900	BODY27	RESULTS	190	Comparable to cell lines, we do not observe increased frequency of aberrant imprinted methylation for any characteristic including reoccurring mutations, hepatitis infections and alcohol consumption in LIHC, smoking status in LUAD or HER2, progesterone or estrogen hormone receptor status in BRCA data sets (Supplementary Figs 25–28).
944	5589900	BODY28	CONCLUSIONS	191	In this current study, we have generated DNA methylation and CNAs profiles for over 280 cancer cell lines and compared the results with large primary tumor data sets available from the TCGA.
945	5589900	BODY29	CONCLUSIONS	192	Methylation at imprinted loci is unique in that opposing parental alleles have different methylations states that are dictated by parental origin.
946	5589900	BODY29	CONCLUSIONS	193	Unlike other single-copy regions which may be prone to accumulate cancer associated hypermethylation from an initially unmethylated state, imprinted DMRs can either loose or gain methylation.
947	5589900	BODY29	CONCLUSIONS	194	Importantly cancer-associated copy number changes will influence the absolute methylation observed at imprinted DMRs while this is not so important for CIMP, bivalent domains and DMVs.
948	5589900	BODY29	CONCLUSIONS	195	In the majority of cases, we observe that the methylation profiles at imprinted DMRs do not represent epigenetic changes but simply the parental origin of underlying CNAs.
949	5589900	BODY29	CONCLUSIONS	196	In some cases, we predict methylation errors may have occurred within cytogenetically abnormal genomes, but it is not possible to know which aberration, the CNA or methylation defect, occurred first.
950	5589900	BODY29	CONCLUSIONS	197	In addition, it is impossible to know if all copies of a highly amplified region for example PPIEL or GNAS are subject to epimutations, resulting in a mosaic/clonal state.
951	5589900	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	198	It is known that some tumors with higher frequency of cancer-associated hypermethylation are enriched for oncogenic mutations.
952	5589900	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	199	However our detailed analysis was unsuccessful in revealing a clear link with any driver mutation or exposure.
953	5589900	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	200	Mutations in BRAFV600E
954	5589900	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	201	35 and CTNNB1
955	5589900	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	202	36 have been described in colorectal and liver tumors with extensively acquired hypermethylation.
956	5589900	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	203	We fail to identify any association between aberrant imprinted methylation and these two mutations, despite one study in hepatocellular carcinomas reporting enrichment of CTNNB1 mutations in samples with hypomethylation at imprinted loci37.
957	5589900	BODY31	CONCLUSIONS	204	Direct evidence for the role of LOI and cancer comes from the mouse model, in which biallelic expression of Igf2 present on an Apc(Min) background has an increased incidence of colorectal cancers38.
958	5589900	BODY31	CONCLUSIONS	205	However, human data implicating this locus in sporadic cancer is more controversial.
959	5589900	BODY31	CONCLUSIONS	206	Biallelic expression of IGF2 has been associated with hypomethylation of the H19 DMR in colorectal cancer39, rather than the hypermethylation that would predictably lead to reactivation of the maternal allele of IGF2 by ablation of insulator function.
960	5589900	BODY31	CONCLUSIONS	207	This hypomethylation extends to the IGF2-DMR0 region and was reported to occur in the normal colonic mucosa of patients, suggesting that this epigenetic abnormality is not limited to the tumors.
961	5589900	BODY31	CONCLUSIONS	208	Methylation data from TCGA COAD data set supports the observed hypomethylation at both these paternally methylated DMRs (cg19642877 is the only probe on the HM450k platform mapping within IGF2-DMR0 with methylation somatically acquired DMR, therefore this was not included in our analysis) but there is no evidence for aberrant methylation in adjacent normal tissues (Supplementary Data 9), endorsing the reports that methylation at this regions is not a predisposing constitution biomarker for colorectal cancer40.
962	5589900	BODY32	CONCLUSIONS	209	Cultured cancer cell lines are widely used models and have help form the fundamental basis for our current understanding of cancer biology.
963	5589900	BODY32	CONCLUSIONS	210	However the use of such an in vitro system has limitations.
964	5589900	BODY32	CONCLUSIONS	211	These include cell line misidentification41 and inter-laboratory clonal expansion or induce secondary genomic changes that may occur since these originally heterogeneous cell lines have been maintained for decades in different culture conditions.
965	5589900	BODY32	CONCLUSIONS	212	To limit these oversights, we have performed our genotyping and methylation analyses on the same DNA samples obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, with quantitative and allelic conformation performed on these DNA aliquots.
966	5589900	BODY32	CONCLUSIONS	213	Furthermore the results of our allelic expression profiling are consistent with examples reported in literature.
967	5589900	BODY32	CONCLUSIONS	214	For example, the methylation and allelic expression of DIRAS3 in the breast cell lines UM159 and CAL51 as reported by Niemczyk et al.42, and the H19 methylation profile of the colorectal cell lines COLO-205 and LoVo are similar to those reported more than 10 years ago43.
968	5589900	BODY32	CONCLUSIONS	215	We also observe identical hypermethylation in the liver cancer cell lines at the RB1 (HLE and HuH-7) and MEG3 DMRs (HLE and HuH-7)44–46 although our data suggests that these profiles are due to cnnLOH.
969	5589900	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	216	While we are confident that our allelic expression results are consistent with previous reports and reflect the expression status in the cell lines, results are sometimes not as would be predicted.
970	5589900	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	217	For example in the colon cell line HCT-116, we observe robust monoallelic expression despite the H19 DMR being methylated on both alleles.
971	5589900	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	218	This is further complicated by the fact that the nearby cis-regulated somatic IGF2-DMR0 maintains allelic methylation consistent with previous reports39.
972	5589900	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	219	In addition the COLO-205 is heterozygous for the reciprocally imprinted, co-regulated H19 and IGF2 genes.
973	5589900	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	220	However, we observe a discordant expression pattern with maintained monoallelic expression of H19 and biallelic expression of IGF2, a situation that has previous been reported in lung adenocarcinomas47.
974	5589900	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	221	One possible explanation for the latter observation is that expression of IGF2 has switched from the predominant P3/P4 imprinted promoters to the tissue-specific non-imprinted P1 promoter48.
975	5589900	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	222	A similar scenario may account for the biallelic expression of MEST observed in many cell lines despite the DMR being hypermethylated, however since the SNP used to discriminate alleles is located beyond PCR range, we are unable to demonstrate promoter switching.
976	5589900	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	223	To conclude, the involvement of imprinting in cancer has gained much attention, but very few studies have taken CNAs into account when reporting methylation profiles.
977	5589900	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	224	This has resulted in the inflated documenting of somatically acquired epigenetic errors at imprinted loci in cancer.
978	5589900	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	225	Our data strongly suggest that CNAs should be investigated before reporting an epigenetic change at imprinted loci in cancer.
979	5589900	BODY35	METHODS	226	Cell line DNA used for confirmation analyses were obtained directly from the Sanger Institute.
980	5589900	BODY35	METHODS	227	All cell lines cultured in-house, except two, were obtained from ATCC repository and grown using conditions recommended by the supplier.

983	5589900	BODY36	METHODS	230	Control liver, breast, colon and lung tissue samples were obtained from Catalan Tumor Biobank (http://www.clinicbiobanc.org/) with DNA extracted with phenol/chloroform using phase-lock gel columns (5 Prime) and RNA extracted with Trizol (Thermofisher) following standard protocols.
984	5589900	BODY36	METHODS	231	cDNA synthesis was performed using 1ug of RNA following an initial DNase treatment (amplification grade DNase I, Invitrogen).
985	5589900	BODY36	METHODS	232	Reverse transcription was performed with MMLV retrotranscriptase (Promega) and random primers (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
986	5589900	BODY36	METHODS	233	Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Institutional Review Boards of the Bellvitge Institute for Biomedical Research (PR223/09) and (PR024/11).
987	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	234	The Illumina Infinium HM450k methylation data sets for cancer cell lines and primary samples was obtained from COSMIC cell line project (GEO number GSE68379) and TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov), respectively.
988	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	235	Pre-processing and normalization were performed following GenomeStudio (Illumina) using the Bioconductor minfi package50.
989	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	236	This includes background subtraction and control normalization.
990	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	237	After normalization, methylation beta (β) values range from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated).
991	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	238	Before analysis, we excluded possible sources of technical bias and genetic variation that could influence results.
992	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	239	We discarded, firstly, all probes with a detection P-value > 0.01 in more than 10 % of the samples and secondly, those with missing values in one or more of the tested samples.
993	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	240	We also discarded those probes containing a common SNP (minor allele frequency ≥ 1%, dbSNP138) in the flanking 5 bp of the interrogated CpG site.
994	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	241	Finally, we removed all probes mapping to the X and Y chromosomes.
995	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	242	All analyses were performed using human genome version 19 (hg19) as the reference genome.
996	5589900	BODY37	METHODS	243	When applicable, coordinates from hg18 to hg19 version were converted using LiftOver tool from USCS Genome Browser website (https://genome.ucsc.edu).
997	5589900	BODY38	METHODS	244	Epigenetic profiles: Infinium HM450k probes located within bivalent domain, DMV and CIMP regions were extracted according to published coordinates26, 27, 29.
998	5589900	BODY38	METHODS	245	For each sample the average β-value of the probes located within each defined interval was calculated.
999	5589900	BODY38	METHODS	246	For subsequent methylation analysis, only regions that were uniformly unmethylated (<0.2 average β-value) in normal tissues (n = 19 breast, n = 12 colon, n = 10 liver and n = 7 lung) were selected.
1000	5589900	BODY38	METHODS	247	We categorized the intervals according to the severity of methylation gains as compared to their corresponding normal tissue controls, being lowly methylated (mean of controls + 0.2), mildly methylated (absolute β-value > 0.5) and highly methylated (absolute β-value > 0.75).
1001	5589900	BODY39	METHODS	248	Imprinted methylation analysis: Infinium HM450k probes located within 37 germline imprinted DMRs which have more than one probe were extracted from loci defined by methyl-seq17.
1002	5589900	BODY39	METHODS	249	For each sample, the average methylation at each imprinted DMRs was calculated.
1003	5589900	BODY39	METHODS	250	Briefly, we classified hyper/hypomethylated imprinted DMR when averaged β-values are above or below 0.8/0.2.
1004	5589900	BODY39	METHODS	251	We also calculated intermediate methylation defects when samples show ± 0.2 β-value relative to controls, but the absolute methylation do not reach 0.8/0.2 cutoff values.
1005	5589900	BODY39	METHODS	252	For each cancer type, methylation analyses for cell lines and TCGA samples were performed independently using the same criteria.
1006	5589900	BODY39	METHODS	253	For TCGA data set, methylation level of an individual tumor sample was compared to its corresponding non-tumor adjacent-paired tissue, whereas methylation level for each cancer cell line was compared to the averaged β-values of corresponding normal tissue controls.
1007	5589900	BODY40	METHODS	254	Processed-RRBS data for A549, T47D, MCF7, HCT-116 and HepG2 cell lines were downloaded from ENCODE project51 (GEO accession number: GSE27584).
1008	5589900	BODY40	METHODS	255	At each CpG site, the methylation rate was calculated as the ratio of methylated reads (C) over the total read count (C + T) at that site.
1009	5589900	BODY40	METHODS	256	Similar to Infinium HM450k data, CpG sites within imprinted DMRs were extracted according to coordinates17 and the average methylation at each imprinted DMR was calculated using RRBS-detected cytosines covered by ≥ 10 reads.
1010	5589900	BODY40	METHODS	257	The association between methylation level at imprinted DMRs obtained from Infinium HM450k and RRBS methods was assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient.
1011	5589900	BODY41	METHODS	258	Predicted methylation analysis: we obtained Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP6.0 genotyping profile of 287 cancer cell lines and 2676 TCGA primary tissues from the Sanger Institutes COSMIC cell line project and TCGA data portal.
1012	5589900	BODY41	METHODS	259	A total of 306 cancer cell lines (derived from 51 breast cancers, 54 colorectal cancers; 20 hepatocarcinomas and 181 lung tumors) had Infinium HM450k array data, allowing us to determine the association between CNAs and DNA methylation.
1013	5589900	BODY41	METHODS	260	At the time of this study (2013 onwards) only 178 TCGA primary tissues had pair data copy-number and methylation data.
1014	5589900	BODY41	METHODS	261	To obtain the CNA predicted methylation value we first determined the minor methylation value as the ratio between the minor and the total allele count.
1015	5589900	BODY41	METHODS	262	Then, if this corresponded to an Infinium HM450k value below 0.5, we assume that the methylated allele was the minor one and reported the minor methylation value as the CNA predicted methylation.
1016	5589900	BODY41	METHODS	263	If the corresponding Infinium HM450k value was above 0.5, we assumed that the methylated allele was the major one and report 1—minor methylation value as the CNA predicted methylation.
1017	5589900	BODY42	METHODS	264	To estimate the proportion of methylation variance explained by copy-number we used univariate linear regression.
1018	5589900	BODY42	METHODS	265	For each imprinted region and tissue type, we fit a model with the average observed methylation as outcome and the expected-by-copy-number methylation (described above) as predictor, considering the different cell lines as observations and obtaining the corresponding coefficient of determination (R2).
1019	5589900	BODY43	METHODS	266	CNA analysis: We used Level 3 CNA estimations for TCGA samples (BRCA n = 1044; COAD n = 429; LIHC n = 208; LUAD n = 494 and LUSC n = 501).
1020	5589900	BODY43	METHODS	267	For the cell lines, we used the CONAN copy number estimations.
1021	5589900	BODY43	METHODS	268	CNAs were selected if they overlapped an imprinted DMR by at least 1 bp.
1022	5589900	BODY43	METHODS	269	We defined an amplification/deletion to be internal if it was more than 1 Mb away from the corresponding telomere/centromere (whichever is closer).
1023	5589900	BODY43	METHODS	270	For TCGA data, we utilized all available data (even if no methylation data was available) and estimated copy number using circular binary segmentation algorithm as implemented in PSCBS52.
1024	5589900	BODY44	METHODS	271	Mutation status in cancer cell lines: We obtained mutational data for all cell lines from the repository Cell Line Project release v76 (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines).

1028	5589900	BODY46	METHODS	275	For confirmation of methylation profiles in normal tissues and cancer cell lines standard bisulphite conversion of approximately 1 μg DNA was subjected to sodium bisulphite treatment and purified using the EZ DNA methylation-Gold kit (ZYMO, Orange, CA).
1029	5589900	BODY46	METHODS	276	Approximately 2 ul of converted DNA was used in each amplification reaction using Immolase Taq polymerase (Bioline) at 45 cycles and the resulting PCR product cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) for subsequent subcloning and sequencing (for primer sequence see Supplementary Data 10).
1030	5589900	BODY47	METHODS	277	Approximately 50 ng of bisulphite converted DNA was used for pyrosequencing of imprinted DMR or repeat elements30, 53.
1031	5589900	BODY47	METHODS	278	Standard bisulphite PCR was used to amplify the regions of interest with the exception that one primer was biotinylated (for primer sequences see Supplementary Data 10).
1032	5589900	BODY47	METHODS	279	For sequencing, forward primers were designed to the complementary strand.
1033	5589900	BODY47	METHODS	280	The pyrosequencing reaction was carried out on a PyroMark Q96 instrument.

1055	8936524	TITLE	TITLE	0	Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance to LSD1 inhibitors in small cell lung cancer occurs through a TEAD4‐driven transcriptional state
1056	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a heterogeneous disease, consisting of intratumoral and intertumoral neuroendocrine (ASCL1 and/or NEUROD1), mesenchymal‐like, and YAP‐driven transcriptional states.
1057	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	Lysine‐specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as KDM1A) inhibitors have recently been progressed to clinical trials in SCLC based on a promising preclinical antitumor activity.
1058	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	A potential clinical limitation of LSD1 inhibitors is the heterogeneous drug responses that have been observed in SCLC cell lines and patient‐derived models.
1059	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Based on these observations, we studied molecular and transcriptional signatures that predict patient response to this class of drug.
1060	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	Employing SCLC patient‐derived transcriptional signatures, we define that SCLC cell lines sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors are enriched in neuroendocrine transcriptional markers, whereas cell lines enriched in a mesenchymal‐like transcriptional program demonstrate intrinsic resistance to LSD1 inhibitors.
1061	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	We have identified a reversible, adaptive resistance mechanism to LSD1 inhibitors through epigenetic reprogramming to a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like state.
1062	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	7	Our data suggest that only a segment of SCLC patients, with a defined neuroendocrine differentiation state, will likely benefit from LSD1 inhibitors.
1063	8936524	ABS0	ABSTRACT	8	It provides novel evidence for the selection of a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like subpopulation resistant to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC patients that may require effective drug combinations to sustain effective clinical responses.
1064	8936524	ABS1	ABSTRACT	9	Here, we identify intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity limits the activity of LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC.
1065	8936524	ABS1	ABSTRACT	10	Activity of LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC is confided in cells enriched in neuroendocrine transcriptional programs.
1066	8936524	ABS1	ABSTRACT	11	Transdifferentiation of SCLC into a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like state represents an acquired resistance mechanism to LSD1 inhibitors.
1067	8936524	ABS1	ABSTRACT	12	Drug combinations targeting YAP‐TEAD pathways with LSD1 inhibitors may be an effective strategy to target intrinsic‐ and adaptive‐resistant populations and sustain effective clinical responses.

1089	8936524	BODY21	BACKGROUND	34	Small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine carcinoma that exhibits aggressive malignancy and a high propensity for early metastasis.
1090	8936524	BODY21	BACKGROUND	35	In addition to common mutations in RB1 and TP53, molecular profiling studies have identified an epigenetic basis for SCLC disease initiation and progression featuring frequent mutations in chromatin‐modifying genes including CREBBP, EP300, and MLL1/2 as well as alterations in the distribution of DNA methylation [1].
1091	8936524	BODY21	BACKGROUND	36	Based on these observations, epigenetic drugs have been explored for therapeutic intervention to target tumor‐specific epigenetic vulnerabilities and reverse acquired epigenetic changes driving tumor growth and survival.
1092	8936524	BODY21	BACKGROUND	37	Promising in vitro and in vivo preclinical data led to clinical trials exploring the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors including romidepsin or panobinostat in relapsed SCLC.
1093	8936524	BODY21	BACKGROUND	38	Although both agents were well‐tolerated and demonstrated some evidence of tumor shrinkage and sustained stable disease, both clinical studies failed to demonstrate a significant benefit warranting continued development [2].
1094	8936524	BODY22	BACKGROUND	39	The emergence of a new generation of epigenetic drugs targeting specific transcriptional regulators of SCLC oncogenesis including BRD4, LSD1, and EZH2 has renewed interest in exploring epigenetic therapies in SCLC [3, 4, 5].
1095	8936524	BODY22	BACKGROUND	40	Among this class of new epigenetic drugs, inhibitors of the histone lysine demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A) have gained significant attention [6].
1096	8936524	BODY22	BACKGROUND	41	LSD1 is a member of the BRAF‐HDAC (BHC) corepressor complex shown to regulate expression of neuronal gene programs through interaction with REST [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12].
1097	8936524	BODY22	BACKGROUND	42	In addition to the previously reported antitumor activity in acute myeloid leukemia, LSD1 inhibitors have shown lineage‐specific activity in SCLC cell lines and patient‐derived xenograft models [5, 6, 13, 14, 15].
1098	8936524	BODY22	BACKGROUND	43	Although the mechanism of growth arrest conferred by these drugs is unclear, LSD1 has been shown to regulate neuroendocrine transcriptional programs critical for SCLC growth [5, 13].
1099	8936524	BODY22	BACKGROUND	44	Several recent reports have suggested that the primary mechanism of action of LSD1 inhibitors in both AML and SCLC occurs not only through catalytic inhibition of LSD1 enzymatic function but also through inhibition of the interaction of LSD1 with SNAG domain transcriptional factors such as INSM and GFI1B [14, 15].
1100	8936524	BODY22	BACKGROUND	45	Through these inhibitory mechanisms, LSD1 inhibitors can impact the expression of neuroendocrine lineage‐specific regulators such as ASCL1, required for SCLC lineage specification.
1101	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	46	Recent studies have characterized SCLC as heterogeneous population, consisting of intratumoral and intertumoral neuroendocrine (ASCL1/NEUROD1), mesenchymal‐like, and YAP‐driven transcriptional states and subtypes [16, 17].
1102	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	47	The particular SCLC subtypes may define vulnerabilities to therapeutic targets.
1103	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	48	In a breadth of efficacy screen, Mohammad et al.
1104	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	49	[5] identified only a subset of SCLC cell lines and primary samples with a DNA hypomethylation signature undergoing growth inhibition in response to GSK2879552.
1105	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	50	Similarly, in a panel of SCLC PDX tumors, Augert et al.
1106	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	51	[13] identified selective activity of ORY‐1001 only in models capable of NOTCH pathway activation.
1107	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	52	Moreover, many sensitive SCLC cell lines and primary tumor models display only partial responses to LSD1 inhibition even after long durations of treatment.
1108	8936524	BODY23	BACKGROUND	53	The recent advancement of both irreversible and reversible LSD1 inhibitors into SCLC clinical trials warrants the study of potential drug resistance mechanisms that may prevent patients from responding to this class of drugs.
1109	8936524	BODY24	BACKGROUND	54	In this study, we have addressed potential intrinsic and acquired drug resistance mechanisms to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC.
1110	8936524	BODY24	BACKGROUND	55	Utilizing a recently identified gene coexpression network defining SCLC neuroendocrine and mesenchymal states [18, 19], we have identified that sensitivity to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC is confined primarily to cell lines that express neuroendocrine transcriptional programs.
1111	8936524	BODY24	BACKGROUND	56	Heterogeneous drug responses in SCLC cell lines reflect a preexisting cell intrinsic drug resistance mechanism enriched in cell lines expressing mesenchymal‐like transcriptional programs.
1112	8936524	BODY24	BACKGROUND	57	Using single cell RNA‐seq and ATAC‐seq, we demonstrate that continuous treatment with LSD1 inhibitors results in the emergence of drug‐tolerant subclones with a de novo mesenchymal‐like transcriptional state driven through a TEAD4 transcription factor program.
1113	8936524	BODY24	BACKGROUND	58	We also highlight that acquired resistance to LSD1 inhibitors appears as an ‘epi‐stable’ state.
1114	8936524	BODY24	BACKGROUND	59	Under drug withdrawal, drug‐tolerant SCLC cells transition between mesenchymal and neuroendocrine phenotypes and regain sensitivity to the drug.
1115	8936524	BODY24	BACKGROUND	60	Collectively our data provide novel insight in the mechanism contributing to heterogeneous responsiveness of SCLC to LSD1 inhibitors, and selection of mesenchymal‐like enriched subclones is likely to present a barrier to effective single‐agent responses in the clinic.
1116	8936524	BODY25	METHODS	61	Human SCLC cell lines used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) , Sigma‐Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), or Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (DSMZ, Brunswick, Germany) and grown in manufacturer’s specified growth medium and environmental conditions.

1142	8936524	BODY32	METHODS	87	FastQ data generated by HiSeq were QCed and trimmed before being aligned to the HG19 human reference genome and then quantified using the rsem package [22] The RNA‐seq DE (differential expression) analysis was done by using the deseq r package after rsem [23].
1143	8936524	BODY32	METHODS	88	For this analysis, the program used raw counts as input and ran its normalization method using a scaling factor computed as the median of the ratio, for each gene, of its read count over its geometric mean across all lanes.
1144	8936524	BODY33	METHODS	89	The SCLC cell line mRNA expression data were downloaded from CCLE 19Q1 [24].
1145	8936524	BODY33	METHODS	90	For differential expression analysis, genes that are not expressed (TPM < 3 in all cell lines) are first removed, and moderated t‐test was conducted using limma package with Empirical Bayes shrinkage [25] in sensitive (n = 10) vs resistant (n = 12) cell lines using log2‐TPM values with FDR multiple testing correction.
1146	8936524	BODY33	METHODS	91	Differential expression cutoff is set at FDR < 5% and FC > 2.

1148	8936524	BODY33	METHODS	93	To identify enriched pathways associated with LSD1 sensitivity, we calculated a significance score defined as follows: −log2(FDR) X (difference in mean TPM between sensitive and resistant lines) and loaded this score into GSEA prerank for pathway analysis [27].
1149	8936524	BODY33	METHODS	94	The neuroendocrine (NE) and mesenchymal‐like (ML) network signature genes for 53 SCLC CCLE cell lines were defined as previously described [19, 28].
1150	8936524	BODY33	METHODS	95	For overlapping analysis between differential genes and NE/ML network genes, hypergeometric test was performed between each gene set, and the median TPM value of NE or ML module genes was plotted with boxplot with two‐sample t‐test on sensitive and resistant cell lines.
1151	8936524	BODY34	METHODS	96	For TCGA SCLC tumor gene expression analysis, the 2015 UCologne RNA‐seq z‐score data were downloaded from cBio portal (https://www.cbioportal.org/).
1152	8936524	BODY34	METHODS	97	Genes containing NA readings were removed, and duplicated gene names were merged by their mean expression z‐score.

1157	8936524	BODY35	METHODS	102	The single cell suspension was isolated by passing the harvested cells through a 40‐μm FlowmiTM tip strainer followed by incubation with 0.25% Trypsin‐EDTA in ice for 10 min and at 37 °C for 10 min to get a final concentration of 3 × 105 cells·mL−1.
1158	8936524	BODY35	METHODS	103	The single cells were then processed through the Chromium 3′ Single Cell Platform using v2 reagents (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s protocol.

1163	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	108	All downstream analyses, including cell filtering, data normalization, and cell clustering, were performed using the r seurat v3 package [29].
1164	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	109	In brief, to remove low‐quality data, cells that have unique gene counts between 200 and 6000 and mitochondrial reads < 10% were kept for further analysis.
1165	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	110	Read counts were then normalized for total counts in each cell, scaled to 10 000, and then log‐transformed.
1166	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	111	To remove confounding factors associated with assay quality and cell cycle stages, we used SCTransform [30] to regress out percent mitochondrial reads, percent ribosomal reads, and cell cycle S/G2M score in each single cell.
1167	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	112	Top 3000 variable genes were selected for downstream analysis.
1168	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	113	To facilitate single cell comparison between control and LSD1 inhibitor treatment, we used Harmony package [31] with default settings to integrate single cell data and used UMAP [32] for two‐dimensional data embedding.
1169	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	114	Differentially expressed genes between each cluster or control vs drug‐treated cells were called using the Seurat ‘FindMarkers’ function with these parameters: min.pct = 0.2, logfc.
1170	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	115	threshold = 0.25, with a cutoff of FDR < 5%.
1171	8936524	BODY36	METHODS	116	Gene expression values or scores in UMAP were capped at 5% and 95% quantile to eliminate outlier bias during data representation.
1172	8936524	BODY37	METHODS	117	NCI‐H69 cells were treated in triplicate with DMSO or 0.3 μm GSK690 for 21 days.
1173	8936524	BODY37	METHODS	118	The transposition assay was performed.
1174	8936524	BODY37	METHODS	119	Briefly, 50 000 nuclei from each sample were used in each reaction with 20 µL of transposition mix and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min.
1175	8936524	BODY37	METHODS	120	qPCR was performed, and eight cycles were performed.
1176	8936524	BODY37	METHODS	121	The library was purified with Ampure XP beads (A63880, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), quantified using Qubit (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Q32851, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA), and checked for size distribution using 4200 TapeStation (High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape, 5067‐5584, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
1177	8936524	BODY37	METHODS	122	Sequencing was performed with Illumina HiSeq4000 (San Diego, CA, USA) (50 bp PE, Nextera v2 libraries).
1178	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	123	For ATAC‐seq data analysis, paired‐end sequencing reads for each sample were mapped to hg38 human reference genome with Bowtie 2 [33] using the following parameters: ‐t ‐X 2000 ‐‐no‐mixed ‐‐no‐discordant.
1179	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	124	Sam files were converted into Bam with samtools.
1180	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	125	Peak calling was performed with MACS2 [34] using these parameters: callpeak ‐g hs ‐‐nolambda ‐‐nomodel ‐‐shift ‐100 ‐‐extsize 200 ‐‐bdg ‐‐SPMR ‐q 5e‐2.
1181	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	126	Peaks overlap with ENCODE black list regions were removed from downstream analysis using bedtools.
1182	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	127	BedGraph files were converted to Bigwig using bedgraphtobigwig [35], and signal tracks were visualized with IGV [36].
1183	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	128	To correct for ATAC‐seq bias, we extracted genome‐wide signal at 100‐bp resolution using deeptools [37] and performed quantile normalization on the signal data using the r package preprocesscore (https://rdrr.io/bioc/preprocessCore/).
1184	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	129	Differential peak calling between the control and drug‐treated samples was performed with DESeq2 [38], using merged peaks between all samples (total 250 646 peaks).
1185	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	130	Significant differential peaks were defined as follows: FDR < 0.01 & fold change > 2.5, and the mean read count for each peak is > 40% quantile of all mean read count (to remove low signal regions).
1186	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	131	This results in 548 open peaks and 838 closed peaks after drug treatment.
1187	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	132	GREAT analysis [39] was performed on the differential peaks to identify pathways associated with the drug treatment.
1188	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	133	To predict transcription factor (TF) binding perturbed by the drug treatment, we employed chromvar package [40] with the ‘human_pwms_v2 motif’ database to identify TF binding DNA motifs that are significantly open or closed upon treatment.
1189	8936524	BODY38	METHODS	134	t‐Test with FDR correction was performed on all TF z‐scores to identify significant TF motifs.
1190	8936524	BODY39	RESULTS	135	Overexpression of chromatin modifiers has been shown to influence their function in cancer [41].
1191	8936524	BODY39	RESULTS	136	In lung cancer, LSD1 mRNA expression is highly expressed in SCLC relative to other lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A).
1192	8936524	BODY39	RESULTS	137	Expression datasets from Clinical Lung Cancer Genome Project (CLCGP) [42] confirm LSD1 is also expressed highly relative to other lung cancer subtypes in primary patient samples (Fig. 1B).
1193	8936524	BODY39	RESULTS	138	To further confirm LSD1 expression levels at the protein level, we conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a lung cancer tissue microarray.
1194	8936524	BODY39	RESULTS	139	IHC staining confirmed a statistically significantly higher staining intensity in SCLC specimens relative to that of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (1‐way ANOVA Fig. 1C,D).
1195	8936524	BODY41	RESULTS	140	Resulting from the observation of high expression of LSD1 in SCLC, we assessed whether SCLC cell lines were dependent on LSD1 activity for their growth.
1196	8936524	BODY41	RESULTS	141	Using two shRNAs targeting LSD1, we observed growth inhibition in the NCI‐H526 cell line that became strongest after 14 days of target knockdown (Fig. S1A).
1197	8936524	BODY41	RESULTS	142	Interestingly, DMS‐114 cells did not appear sensitive to LSD1 knockdown over 14 days even though there was a significant loss of LSD1 protein level by western blot (Fig. S1B).
1198	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	143	Several reports have recently described sensitivity in SCLC cell lines to LSD1 inhibitors.
1199	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	144	To study this further, we profiled drug sensitivity to the FAD reversible inhibitor GSK690 (Ki = 4 nm) [20] as well as the FAD irreversible compound OG‐86 (IC50 = 47 nm) [21] in a panel of SCLC cell lines (Fig. S2).
1200	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	145	Due to the delayed onset of proliferation changes observed in shRNA experiments, we tested the effects of GSK690 and OG‐86 on SCLC cell line growth in long‐term proliferation assays of 17–21 days.
1201	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	146	Consistent with shRNA results, we observed differential responses in many SCLC cell lines.
1202	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	147	In NCI‐H1417, NCI‐H187, and NCI‐H889 cells, dose‐dependent growth inhibition was initially observed at 7–10 days of both GSK690 and OG‐86 treatments with continued effects observed until days 17–21 (Fig. S3A–C).
1203	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	148	DMS‐114 cells, which were insensitive to LSD1 shRNA knockdown, were also insensitive to both GSK690 and OG‐86 up to 17 days of treatment at concentrations up to 1.0 µm OG‐86 and 1.0 µm GSK690 (Fig. S3D).
1204	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	149	Treatment with LSD1 inhibitors resulted in cytostatic responses in sensitive SCLC cell lines.
1205	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	150	In COR‐L88 and NCI‐H1417 cells, an increase in sub‐G1 phase was observed upon 7 days of GSK690 treatment (Fig. S3E) along with an increase in cells in G1 phase (42% G1 for 1 µm GSK690 vs 25% G1 for DMSO in COR‐L88 cells; Fig. S3F).
1206	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	151	In contrast, GSK690 treatment in NCI‐H526 arrested cell growth without obvious accumulation in any stage of the cell cycle (Fig. S3E).
1207	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	152	Interestingly, the antiproliferative effects of LSD1 inhibitors plateau in their percent inhibition even after 17–21 days of continuous drug treatment due to the emergence of a subpopulation of slowly proliferative persister cells in NCI‐H1417 and NCI‐H187 cells (Fig. S3).
1208	8936524	BODY42	RESULTS	153	These data suggest that SCLC cell lines possess both intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to LSD1 inhibitors.
1209	8936524	BODY43	RESULTS	154	Across the SCLC cell line panel, 12 out of 29 tested SCLC cell lines showed > 50% growth inhibition in response to 0.3 µm GSK690 treatment at day 17 (Fig. 2A).
1210	8936524	BODY43	RESULTS	155	A nonenzymatic mechanism of action has recently been proposed to account for the antitumor activity of LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC [15].
1211	8936524	BODY43	RESULTS	156	In our cell panel, we identified that all SCLC cell lines sensitive to GSK690 express SNAG domain proteins INSM1 or GFI1B; however, we also observed examples of INSM1 or GFI1B‐expressing cell lines that were also resistant to the drug (Fig. 2C).
1212	8936524	BODY43	RESULTS	157	Thus, the expression of SNAG domain proteins alone is insufficient to define cell lines that will respond to GSK690.
1213	8936524	BODY45	RESULTS	158	To identify additional biomarkers that predict sensitivity to GSK690, we explored both mutational and gene expression features of SCLC cell lines from available CCLE data [24] LSD1 expression level alone did not correlate with drug sensitivity (Fig. 2B,C).
1214	8936524	BODY45	RESULTS	159	Additionally, using both univariate and multivariate association methods, no mutation significantly correlated with cell line sensitivity (data not shown).
1215	8936524	BODY45	RESULTS	160	Analysis of the cell line gene expression by principal component analysis suggests that cell lines sensitive to GSK690 stratify in a group with distinct transcriptional state compared to insensitive cell lines with exception of NCI‐H526 and NCI‐H1963 cells that appear to be outliers (Fig. S4A).
1216	8936524	BODY45	RESULTS	161	SCLC cell lines can be stratified by neuroendocrine/epithelial (NE) and mesenchymal‐like (ML) features.
1217	8936524	BODY45	RESULTS	162	Using established gene expression markers of these SCLC cell states [16, 17], we found enrichment in GSK690‐sensitive cell lines in expression of epithelial genes, MYCL and EPCAM, and neuroendocrine genes, GRP, DDC, and ASCL1 (Fig. 2B,C and Fig. S5).
1218	8936524	BODY45	RESULTS	163	SCLC cell lines resistant to GSK690 featured higher expression of mesenchymal genes MYC, ZEB1, and VIM (Fig. 2B,C and Fig. S5).
1219	8936524	BODY45	RESULTS	164	These data suggest that neuroendocrine‐like SCLC cell lines may be more sensitive to LSD1 inhibition while mesenchymal‐like SCLC states may confer resistance to LSD1 inhibitors.
1220	8936524	BODY46	RESULTS	165	To experimentally address the intrinsic drug resistance of mesenchymal‐shifted SCLC cells to LSD1 inhibitors, we treated a mesenchymal variant form of NCI‐H69 cells, NCI‐H69V [43] with GSK690.
1221	8936524	BODY46	RESULTS	166	NCI‐H69 cells grow in suspension and show enrichment in NE transcription factors FOXA2, SOX2, LEF1, NCAM, and E‐cadherin (Fig. 2D).
1222	8936524	BODY46	RESULTS	167	In contrast, NCI‐H69V cells grow as adherent cells and express a ML signature‐enriched transcription factors SMAD3, MYC, ZEB1, and VIM [19] (Fig. 2D).
1223	8936524	BODY46	RESULTS	168	In line with our hypothesis, mesenchymal‐shifted NCI‐H69V appeared to be resistant to GSK690 treatment, showing only 22% growth inhibition compared with 85% growth inhibition observed in parental NCI‐H69 cells (Fig. 2D).
1224	8936524	BODY47	RESULTS	169	To further refine the gene expression signature associated with LSD1 inhibitor resistance, we performed differential expression analysis between LSD1 inhibition sensitive and resistant SCLC cells from CCLE cell line data.
1225	8936524	BODY47	RESULTS	170	Using this approach, we identified a differential gene expression signature (FDR < 5% and FC > 2) stratifying cell lines sensitive and resistant to LSD1 inhibitors (Fig. 3A).
1226	8936524	BODY47	RESULTS	171	By performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [27] on these differential genes, we found that gene sets of ASCL1 targets, epithelial differentiation, and ZEB1 repressive sites are upregulated in the sensitive cells, whereas EMT, TGF‐beta, and MYC pathway gene sets are significantly upregulated in the resistant cells (Fig. 3B).
1227	8936524	BODY49	RESULTS	172	Since sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition was associated with the presence or absence of expression of canonical neuroendocrine and mesenchymal markers in our previous analysis, we compared the GSK690 differentially expressed gene signature to an established gene coexpression network that delineates tumor heterogeneity observed in SCLC tumor samples as neuroendocrine (NE) and mesenchymal‐like (ML) [18, 19].
1228	8936524	BODY49	RESULTS	173	Aligning the LSD1 inhibition differential expression signature to genes defining the NE (n = 1102) or ML (n = 2663) coexpression networks [19], we found that sensitive cell lines significantly upregulated NE network genes, while resistant lines significantly upregulated ML network genes (Fig. 3C).
1229	8936524	BODY49	RESULTS	174	In addition, genes upregulated in LSD1 inhibitor sensitive cell lines significantly overlapped with NE network genes while genes upregulated in LSD1 inhibitor‐resistant cell lines significantly overlapped with the ML network genes (Fig. S4B).
1230	8936524	BODY49	RESULTS	175	Overall, these data highlight the context specificity of GSK690 activity in neuroendocrine SCLC subtypes and explain the heterogeneous drug responses observed in SCLC cell lines.
1231	8936524	BODY50	RESULTS	176	We next assessed the potential of the LSD1 sensitivity signature in identification of SCLC patients that might be sensitive or resistant to LSD1 inhibition.
1232	8936524	BODY50	RESULTS	177	Using the differential gene expression signatures that stratify cell lines sensitive and resistant to LSD1 inhibitors (Fig. 3A), TCGA 2015 UCologne SCLC patient dataset was analyzed.
1233	8936524	BODY50	RESULTS	178	Patients with high expression of NE genes correlated with genes increased in expression in the LSD1 sensitivity signature score.
1234	8936524	BODY50	RESULTS	179	Conversely, patients enriched in ML signature overlapped with LSD1 inhibitor resistance gene expression (Fig. 3D).
1235	8936524	BODY50	RESULTS	180	Thus, the LSD1 inhibitor gene expression signature defined distinct subsets of SCLC patients that are predicted to be either sensitive or resistant to LSD1 inhibitors.
1236	8936524	BODY51	RESULTS	181	Small‐cell lung cancer cell lines grow in floating cell aggregates; however, a subset of cell lines will grow attached to tissue culture plastic [44, 45].
1237	8936524	BODY51	RESULTS	182	Cell lines which grow in suspension tend to express neuroendocrine markers while adherently growing cell lines are enriched in mesenchymal biomarkers [19].
1238	8936524	BODY51	RESULTS	183	SCLC cells that persist after day 10 of 0.3 µm GSK690 treatment show profound morphologic changes.
1239	8936524	BODY51	RESULTS	184	NCI‐H526 cells changed from loose floating aggregate to tightly adherent spheres (Fig. 4A).
1240	8936524	BODY51	RESULTS	185	COR‐L88 cells changed morphologically and gained adherence to tissue culture‐treated plates at day 12 of GSK690 treatment (Fig. 4A).
1241	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	186	Since morphological changes are known to occur in SCLC cells that transition to a mesenchymal state [46], we assessed whether LSD1 inhibitor persister populations shift to a mesenchymal differentiation state.
1242	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	187	We performed bulk RNA‐seq on four sensitive cell lines (NCI‐H889, NCI‐H1417, NCI‐H69, and COR‐L88) and two insensitive cell lines (NCI‐H82 and NCI‐H1694).
1243	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	188	At day 10 of GSK690 treatment, a larger number of genes show changes in all four sensitive cell lines, with the majority of genes showing upregulation (FDR < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2) (Fig. 4B).
1244	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	189	Interestingly, only five genes and 43 genes were significantly altered after 10 days of GSK690 treatment in two GSK690‐insensitive models, NCI‐H82 and NCI‐H1694, respectively (Fig. 4B).
1245	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	190	Evaluation of common transcriptional changes occurring in sensitive models revealed only seven genes as consistently altered (FDR < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2) in expression at day 10 in all four cells lines (Fig. 4C).
1246	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	191	However, the data showed more convergence at a pathway level with several common pathways identified showing consistent changes due to GSK690 treatment in the four sensitive cell lines.
1247	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	192	Pathways associated with genes upregulated by GSK690 treatment are enrichment in epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathway, TGF‐beta signaling, NOTCH signaling, and focal adhesion‐related signaling consistent with the observed changes in adhesion (Fig. 4D, Fig. S4C).
1248	8936524	BODY53	RESULTS	193	Conversely, pathways enriched in genes downregulated by GSK690 treatment did not show overlap between different cell lines and include various signaling pathways (Fig. 4D, Fig. S4C).
1249	8936524	BODY54	RESULTS	194	Changes in neuroendocrine and mesenchymal markers were also observed at the protein level in GSK690‐sensitive cell models (Fig. S6).
1250	8936524	BODY54	RESULTS	195	COR‐L88 cells showed the strongest shift into a mesenchymal‐like state showing downregulation of neuroendocrine proteins NSE, GRP, NCAM, and CHGA and neuroendocrine transcription factors FOXA2, ASCL1, and SOX2.
1251	8936524	BODY54	RESULTS	196	COR‐L88 cells also showed strong upregulation of the mesenchymal protein VIM.
1252	8936524	BODY54	RESULTS	197	Other GSK690‐sensitive cell models showed only small changes in protein levels across our panel with GRP reduction and ZEB1 and CDH2 upregulation being the most consistent markers of response (Fig. S6).
1253	8936524	BODY54	RESULTS	198	We observed no consistent changes in the protein levels of any neuroendocrine and mesenchymal markers in GSK690‐insensitive cell lines.
1254	8936524	BODY54	RESULTS	199	Importantly, the extent of mesenchymal gene induction in GSK690‐treated SCLC cells does appear comparatively lower relative to what we observed in mesenchymal‐shifted NCI‐H69V cells and thus may represent a ‘partial EMT’ [47].
1255	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	200	To define the origin of mesenchymal‐like persister cells, we conducted single cell RNA‐seq analysis on NCI‐H69 cells treated with DMSO or 0.3 μm GSK690 for 21 days.
1256	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	201	Harmony [31] was applied to integrate DMSO and treatment groups so that gene expression within each single cell subpopulation can be directly compared with obtain subpopulation‐specific differentially expressed (DE) genes after treatment (Fig. 5A).
1257	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	202	To identify distinct cell subpopulations, unsupervised cell clustering was performed and five clusters were selected manually after visualization using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Fig. 5B and Fig. S7A).
1258	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	203	Cell subpopulations in Clusters 0 and 3 were increased in 0.3 μm GSK690‐treated group relative to the DMSO group (Fig. S7A).
1259	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	204	In contrast, cell subpopulations in Clusters 1 and 2 in DMSO group were reduced after 21 days of LSD1 inhibitor treatment (Fig. S7A).
1260	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	205	There was no significant difference in the Cluster 4 cell subpopulation between DMSO and treated groups.
1261	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	206	Cluster 2 was identified as a neuroendocrine‐like subpopulation, as neuroendocrine transcriptional factors GRP and ASCL1 were specifically upregulated in this subpopulation (Fig. 5B and Fig. S8A).
1262	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	207	Both GRP expression and ASCL1 expression were strongly reduced in Cluster 2 after treatment (Fig. S7B).
1263	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	208	In addition, the mean expression of neuroendocrine markers (NE score) including ASCL1, CHGA, GRP, INSM1, NCAM1, FOXA2, and SOX2 was significantly reduced in Cluster 2 after treatment (Fig. 5C, left), suggesting cells in this cluster are losing NE features.
1264	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	209	On the other hand, the mean expression of 76 EMT marker genes from the Broad MSigDB Hallmark Signatures (EMT score) was upregulated in multiple cell clusters after treatment, but most significantly increased in Cluster 0 (Fig. 5C, right).
1265	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	210	This observation is supported by the significant upregulation of EMT and lung cancer survival pathways in Cluster 0 after treatment (Fig. S8B).
1266	8936524	BODY55	RESULTS	211	Altogether, these results highlight the loss of NE cell subpopulation and the emergence of several transcriptionally distinct, mesenchymal‐like populations in NCI‐H69 cells resistant to LSD1 inhibitors.
1267	8936524	BODY57	RESULTS	212	In an attempt to assess the reversibility of the mesenchymal shift observed in LSD1 inhibitor persister cells, we performed drug washout experiments.
1268	8936524	BODY57	RESULTS	213	After 14 days of GSK690 treatment in NCI‐H526 and NCI‐H69 cells, antiproliferative effects occurred concomitant with the upregulation of mesenchymal markers CDH2, SNA1, MYC, VIM, and ZEB1 and the downregulation of neuroendocrine markers GRP, ASCL1, and CHGA (Fig. S9).
1269	8936524	BODY57	RESULTS	214	After 7 days of drug washout, gene expression signatures recovered in both cell lines to levels similar to that observed in DMSO controls.
1270	8936524	BODY57	RESULTS	215	Moreover, after 7 days of drug washout, cells regained sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition to a similar extent as untreated cell lines (Fig. S9).
1271	8936524	BODY57	RESULTS	216	These data suggest that the mesenchymal shift in SCLC cells treated with LSD1 inhibitors is reversible and caused by an ‘epi‐stable’ mesenchymal‐like differentiation state.
1272	8936524	BODY58	RESULTS	217	We next sought to define the extent of epigenetic reprogramming in LSD1 inhibitor drug‐tolerant cells by employing an assay for transposase‐accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC‐seq).
1273	8936524	BODY58	RESULTS	218	ATAC‐seq data in NCI‐H69 cells treated with 0.3 μm GSK690 for 21 days were highly reproducible between biological replicates and showed clear enrichment at specific genomic regions (Fig. S10A).
1274	8936524	BODY58	RESULTS	219	Consistent with observed changes in gene expression, differentially open or closed chromatin accessibility peaks were primarily identified at distal regulatory regions of genes after 21 days of GSK690 treatment compared with controls (Fig. 6A, Fig. S10B).
1275	8936524	BODY58	RESULTS	220	GREAT gene ontology analysis [39] for genes acquiring open chromatin accessibility peaks near regulatory regions suggests enrichment in pathways involved in mesenchyme morphogenesis and regulation of epithelial cell differentiation (Fig. 6B).
1276	8936524	BODY58	RESULTS	221	In contrast, genes that acquire closed chromatin do not show any significant pathway enrichment.
1277	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	222	To study the transcription factor programs regulating drug‐resistant SCLC cells, we identified the transcription factor motifs represented in differentially accessible, closed or open, chromatin regions after GSK690 treatment (Fig. 6C,D).
1278	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	223	We used chromvar [40], a package designed for inferring transcription factor activity from ATAC‐seq based on chromatin accessibility levels at TF binding motifs genome‐wide (Fig. 6C,D).
1279	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	224	Our analysis demonstrated that NEUROD1/NEUROD2 and ASCL1 DNA binding motifs were significantly closed following GSK690 treatment.
1280	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	225	The DNA binding motif for TEAD4 is the only significantly opened region with the treatment (Fig. 6C,D).
1281	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	226	TEAD4 is a downstream mediator of YAP1 activity, which has been previously identified as a possible phenotypic modulator in a subset of non‐neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines [48].
1282	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	227	A small molecule, TED‐347, was recently discovered to demonstrate covalent engagement of cysteine to inhibit TEAD4·YAP1 protein–protein interaction and block TEAD transcriptional activity [49].
1283	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	228	We treated NCI‐H69 cells with either LSD1 inhibitor GSK690 or combination with TED‐347 for 21 days.
1284	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	229	Combination treatment with TED‐347 significantly prevented the cell regrowth following the drug withdrawal for up to 21 days (Fig. 6E).
1285	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	230	Thus, inhibiting TEAD transcriptional activity prevents the acquired resistance of SCLC in response to LSD1 inhibitors.
1286	8936524	BODY60	RESULTS	231	These data indicate that mesenchymal‐like drug tolerance in SCLC cell lines occurs through epigenetic reprogramming mediated through changes in transcription factor programs driven by oncogenic YAP signaling.
1287	8936524	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	232	In this study, we have identified common features of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance to LSD1 inhibitors through epigenetic changes in SCLC neuroendocrine transcriptional programs.
1288	8936524	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	233	Epigenetic plasticity is known to contribute to the poor durability of responses of SCLC to current therapies as selection of mesenchymal enriched clones become enriched in refractory disease found in relapse [50, 51].
1289	8936524	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	234	Many SCLC cell lines analyzed in this study show either no response or only partial response to LSD1 inhibitors even after 21 days of treatment, suggesting many SCLC cell lines either have a preexisting drug‐resistant population or are capable of transitioning to a drug‐resistant state.
1290	8936524	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	235	Experimentally neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines can transition from neuroendocrine into mesenchymal phenotypes when treated with targeted or chemotherapies [19, 44, 45, 50].
1291	8936524	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	236	This observation is clinically relevant as SCLC tumors are often composed of epigenetically heterogeneous cells with either a neuroendocrine or a mesenchymal profile [18, 19, 50].
1292	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	237	Despite early literature suggesting LSD1 inhibitors would be broadly active in numerous cancers including colon, prostate, and breast cancer [12, 52, 53], the generation of more selective LSD1 inhibitors has clarified the extent of LSD1 inhibitor activity primarily in AML and SCLC [5, 54].
1293	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	238	One possible explanation for this discrepancy is suggested from the recent reports identifying noncatalytic mechanisms of action of current LSD1 inhibitors being explored in the clinic.
1294	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	239	Inhibition of the interaction of LSD1 with SNAG domain‐containing proteins INSM1 or GFI1B impacts expression of key neuroendocrine lineage transcriptional regulators in SCLC including ASCL1 [15].
1295	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	240	Recently, a specific inhibitor of LSD1 enzyme activity has been discovered, T‐448 [55], which has minimal impact on the interaction of the LSD1‐CoRest complex with SNAG domain transcription factors.
1296	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	241	In our studies, T‐448 has no antiproliferative effect on NCI‐H69 cells after 21‐day treatment (Fig. S11), suggesting that the mechanism of action of LSD inhibitors occurs primarily through disruption of the interaction of LSD1 with SNAG domain transcription factors.
1297	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	242	Our data demonstrate that all cell lines sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors express either INSM1 or GFI1B; however, a subset of cell lines resistant to the drug also express these genes.
1298	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	243	Thus, the expression of these SNAG domain‐containing proteins alone does not predict sensitivity to LSD1 inhibitors.
1299	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	244	Interestingly, LSD1 has been found to interact with the SNAG domain of SNAIL and implicated in the transcriptional repression of epithelial markers during EMT transition in breast cancer cells [56].
1300	8936524	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	245	The role of LSD1 in the SNAG domain of targeted proteins appears to be context and lineage specific.
1301	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	246	Our results demonstrate that SCLC cells which have evolved non‐neuroendocrine, mesenchymal‐like transcriptional programs are resistant to LSD1 inhibition.
1302	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	247	These findings are consistent with Mohammad et al., [5] who identified TGF‐beta pathway signatures negatively correlate with LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity in SCLC.
1303	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	248	The TGF‐beta pathway is known to regulate EMT pathways in cancer as well as in normal development [46].
1304	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	249	In cell lines sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors, we did observe enrichment for TGF‐beta pathway genes as well as genes involved in axonal and EMT pathways after LSD1 inhibitor treatment.
1305	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	250	Therefore, these data are potentially consistent with our observation that neuroendocrine and mesenchymal differentiation markers stratify sensitivity of SCLC cell lines to LSD1 inhibitors.
1306	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	251	Augert et al.
1307	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	252	also identified heterogeneous responses to the LSD1 inhibitor ORY‐1001 in a screen of SCLC patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) models [13].
1308	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	253	In their study, PDX models capable of NOTCH activation and concomitant ASCL1 downregulation were enriched in response to LSD1 inhibition.
1309	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	254	In gene expression studies following GSK690 treatment, we did observe induction of NOTCH pathway genes in COR‐L88 and NCI‐H1417 cells but not to the same extent in NCI‐H69 or NCI‐H889 cells.
1310	8936524	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	255	This suggests that NOTCH pathway‐independent mechanisms of LSD1 inhibitor response exist in SCLC.
1311	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	256	This study highlights the remarkable plasticity of SCLC to evolve into drug‐resistant mesenchymal‐like states.
1312	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	257	Along these lines, we found expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1 was downregulated after GSK690 treatment in most models with the exception of NCI‐H526 cells which shows a very low expression level of ASCL1 and is reported that the interaction between LSD1 and SNAG domain protein GFI1B plays a key role in this cell line [15].
1313	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	258	The extent of mesenchymal gene induction in GSK690‐treated SCLC cells does appear comparatively lower relative to what we observed in mesenchymal‐shifted NCI‐H69V cells and thus may represent a ‘partial EMT’ [47].
1314	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	259	In support of this model, drug washout experiments suggest these changes are ‘epi‐stable’ as cells revert to neuroendocrine phenotypes within 7 days of drug removal.
1315	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	260	Additionally, we found many SCLC cell lines analyzed in this study show only partial response to LSD1 inhibitors even after 21 days of treatment, suggesting many SCLC cell lines are capable of transitioning to a drug‐resistant state.
1316	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	261	Single cell RNA‐seq suggests that this resistant population likely represents an acquired drug‐tolerant state represented by transcriptional reprogramming that is maintained under drug selection.
1317	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	262	Consistent with this finding, ATAC‐seq data in NCI‐H69 cells highlighted a shift in the utilization of transcription factors from ASCL1 to TEAD4 in drug‐resistant cells.
1318	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	263	Interestingly, the expression of TEAD4 and downstream YAP and TAZ have recently been highlighted to represent a unique subtype of non‐ASCL1‐driven SCLC [48].
1319	8936524	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	264	Our data suggest that inhibiting TEAD transcriptional activity may be an effective strategy to prevent the acquired resistance of SCLC in response to LSD1 inhibitors.
1320	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	265	A recent phase I study of GSK2879552 in relapsed or refractory SCLC found a disease control rate of 14% (four of 29 patients) [57].
1321	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	266	High rates of adverse events, including thrombocytopenia and encephalopathy, lead to the termination of the study.
1322	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	267	Our data suggest that only a segment of SCLC patients, with a defined neuroendocrine differentiation state, will likely benefit from LSD1 inhibitors.
1323	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	268	In LSD1 inhibitor‐treated patients, a mesenchymal‐like resistant population is likely to persist.
1324	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	269	Thus, emphasis should focus on drug combination approaches that can sustain clinical responses by eliminating cells that maintain residual disease.
1325	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	270	Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that SCLC cells treated with chemotherapy [50] or radiotherapy [58] obtain mesenchymal characteristics that confer drug resistance.
1326	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	271	Thus, the efficacy of LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC patients heavily pretreated with chemotherapy will be an important consideration.
1327	8936524	BODY65	CONCLUSIONS	272	The recent disclosures of additional LSD1 inhibitors, IMG‐7289, INCB059872, and CC‐90011, under clinical development for SCLC highlight the importance of clarifying the mechanism of action as well as further defining the clinical application of these drugs [6].
1328	8936524	BODY66	CONCLUSIONS	273	We discovered that epigenetic plasticity contributes to heterogeneous responsiveness of SCLC to LSD1 inhibitors.
1329	8936524	BODY66	CONCLUSIONS	274	Sensitivity to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC is confined primarily to cells that express neuroendocrine transcriptional programs.
1330	8936524	BODY66	CONCLUSIONS	275	Selection of a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like subpopulation is likely to present a barrier to effective single‐agent responses in the clinic.
1331	8936524	BODY66	CONCLUSIONS	276	Drug combinations targeting the YAP‐TEAD pathways in combination with LSD1 inhibitors may be an effective strategy to target intrinsic and adaptive mesenchymal‐like resistant populations and sustain effective clinical responses.

1334	9722452	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Tumor heterogeneity plays a critical role in tumor development and response to treatment.
1335	9722452	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), intratumoral heterogeneity is driven in part by the Notch signaling pathway, which reprograms neuroendocrine cancer cells to a less/non-neuroendocrine state.
1336	9722452	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	Here we investigated the atypical Notch ligand DLL3 as a biomarker of the neuroendocrine state and a regulator of cell-cell interactions in SCLC.
1337	9722452	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	We first built a mathematical model to predict the impact of DLL3 expression on SCLC cell populations.
1338	9722452	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	We next tested this model using a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to track DLL3 expression in vivo and a new mouse model of SCLC with inducible expression of DLL3 in SCLC tumors.
1339	9722452	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	We found that high levels of DLL3 promote the expansion of a SCLC cell population with lower expression levels of both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine markers.
1340	9722452	ABS0	ABSTRACT	7	This work may influence how DLL3-targeting therapies are used in SCLC patients.

1354	9722452	BODY0	BACKGROUND	21	Tumors consist of a variety of cancer and non-cancer cells.
1355	9722452	BODY0	BACKGROUND	22	Both cancer cells and non-cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment display various levels of heterogeneity.
1356	9722452	BODY0	BACKGROUND	23	This heterogeneity may vary over time and environmental conditions, and it plays an important role in tumor development, including shaping the natural response of tumors to the immune system or treatment in the clinic (reviewed in1,2,3,4).
1357	9722452	BODY1	BACKGROUND	24	SCLC is an aggressive subtype of lung cancer with fast growth rates and a striking metastatic ability.
1358	9722452	BODY1	BACKGROUND	25	The median overall survival of SCLC patients has remained close to 8–10 months in the past 3 decades, with a 5-year survival at ∼6% and over 200,000 estimated deaths worldwide every year.
1359	9722452	BODY1	BACKGROUND	26	Most tumors respond well initially to standard-of-care chemoradiation treatment, but resistance emerges rapidly in nearly all cases (reviewed in5).
1360	9722452	BODY1	BACKGROUND	27	The recent approval of T cell immune checkpoint inhibitors has been beneficial to only a small fraction of SCLC patients (reviewed in6).
1361	9722452	BODY1	BACKGROUND	28	There is a critical need to develop biomarkers for SCLC development and more efficient therapeutic strategies.
1362	9722452	BODY2	BACKGROUND	29	SCLC tumors harbor few non-cancer cells7 but inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity is still a prominent feature of these tumors.
1363	9722452	BODY2	BACKGROUND	30	At the epigenetic/transcriptional level, SCLC tumors have been classified into different subtypes based on transcriptional programs driven by specific transcription factors in cancer cell populations, with the SCLC-A (expressing the ASCL1 transcription factor) and SCLC-N (expressing the NEUROD1 transcription factor) neuroendocrine subtypes being the most frequent in patients.8,9,10 Importantly, mounting evidence indicates that individual SCLC tumors are comprising heterogeneous populations of cancer cells with different levels of neuroendocrine gene programs.11,12,13 As an example of this intratumoral heterogeneity, in SCLC-A tumors, activation of Notch signaling can reprogram neuroendocrine (NE) cancer cells toward less/non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) phenotypes.12 The non-NE cells are less tumorigenic and genetic and pharmacologic approaches to promote NE to non-NE differentiation have been shown to decrease SCLC tumor growth.14 But non-NE can support the survival of the NE cells, including when tumors are treated with chemotherapy.12,15 In this context, the mechanisms activating Notch signaling are not completely understood, but may depend on the YAP transcriptional regulator.16 As another example, in SCLC-N tumors, expression of c-MYC can activate Notch signaling, which also promotes the transition of these tumors to a less neuroendocrine phenotype.17 These data and data from human tumors indicate that both inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity are likely key contributors of the ability of SCLC tumors to become resistant to therapies.8,18,19
1364	9722452	BODY3	BACKGROUND	31	DLL3 (Delta-like ligand 3) is an atypical ligand for NOTCH receptors initially studied for its role in early pattern formation in mouse embryos.20,21,22 Early work showed that DLL3 does not activate Notch signaling but rather functions as an inhibitor of Notch signaling in a cell autonomous manner,23 possibly in a cis-inhibition mechanism in the Golgi.24,25 However, genetic studies of DLL3 O-fucosylation indicate that interactions with NOTCH may not fully account for the physiological function of DLL3, suggesting possible Notch-independent roles for DLL3 in vivo.26 The mouse Dll3 gene is a direct target of ASCL127 and DLL3 is expressed in a significant number of human SCLC tumors.
1365	9722452	BODY3	BACKGROUND	32	Importantly, Saunders and colleagues showed that DLL3 is present at the surface of SCLC cells and that targeting DLL3-expressing SCLC cells using an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) can eradicate SCLC in pre-clinical models.28 Clinical trials using Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), an ADC targeting DLL3, have been unsuccessful largely because of toxic side effects of this molecule (e.g.,29,30,31).
1366	9722452	BODY3	BACKGROUND	33	However, other strategies are being developed to target DLL3 expressing cells, (e.g.,32,33,34,35) and DLL3 remains a target of interest for detection and treatment of SCLC.
1367	9722452	BODY4	BACKGROUND	34	Here we developed tools and models to further investigate the role of DLL3 as a biomarker of SCLC and as a regulator of Notch signaling in SCLC.
1368	9722452	BODY4	BACKGROUND	35	We used mathematical modeling based on published data to predict the potential role that DLL3 expression may have on tumor heterogeneity.
1369	9722452	BODY4	BACKGROUND	36	We further developed a new single-chain fragment variable (scFv) that can bind DLL3 on cells in culture and in vivo.
1370	9722452	BODY4	BACKGROUND	37	Finally, we used this scFv to test our mathematical models in a new genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC with inducible expression of DLL3.
1371	9722452	BODY4	BACKGROUND	38	Our data show variable levels of DLL3 expression in SCLC and indicate that DLL3 expression contributes to intratumoral heterogeneity.
1372	9722452	BODY5	RESULTS	39	DLL3 is often viewed as a cis-inhibitor of Notch signaling during development because of its role in localizing NOTCH receptors in the Golgi (Figure 1A).
1373	9722452	BODY5	RESULTS	40	To determine if DLL3 could suppress Notch activity in SCLC cells, we used cells derived from tumors in the Rbfl/fl;p53fl/fl;Rbl2fl/fl;Hes1GFP/+ mouse model of SCLC (RPR2;Hes1GFP model, also known as TKO;Hes1GFP, for triple knockout).12,16 In this model, SCLC cells express GFP when the Hes1 promoter is active.
1374	9722452	BODY5	RESULTS	41	Because Hes1 is a target of Notch signaling, GFP expression can serve as a reporter of Notch activity, and HES1GFP-positive (HES1pos) cells are less/non-neuroendocrine.12,16 We isolated HES1pos cells from RPR2;Hes1GFPmutant tumors, and ectopic expression of FLAG-tagged DLL3 in these HES1pos cells led to fewer GFP-positive cells, providing further evidence that DLL3 can suppress Notch signaling in cis in this SCLC context (Figures 1B–1D and S1A).

1385	9722452	BODY5	RESULTS	52	See also Figure S1 and Table S1.
1386	9722452	BODY17	RESULTS	53	In the Notch signaling pathway, activation of NOTCH receptors by their ligands, including Delta-like proteins (DLLs), leads to NOTCH cleavage, releasing the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD).
1387	9722452	BODY17	RESULTS	54	NICD induces transcription of the gene coding for HES1, which is an inhibitor of ASCL1, which is itself an activator of the expression of NOTCH ligands (DLLs, representing DLL1/3/4 and Jagged1/2 here).27,36 This negative feedback leads to lateral inhibition and distinct cell fates among neighboring cells: low NOTCH/high DLL (‘sender’) cells and high Notch/low DLL (‘receiver’) cells (Figure 1A).37 To gain a better understanding of the consequences of DLL3 expression on Notch signaling and intratumoral heterogeneity in SCLC, we built a simple mathematical model by incorporating DLL3 in the canonical mutual inhibition model of lateral inhibition38 using the following reactions: (1) NOTCH receptors, denoted N, bind to DLL1 (as a representative of all NOTCH ligands, denoted D) in trans, which leads to cleavage of NOTCH and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), denoted S; (2) NICD increases expression of HES1, denoted H39; (3) HES1 inhibits expression of DLL127,36; (4) NOTCH receptors bind to DLL1 and DLL3, denoted D3, in cis, which inhibits NOTCH cleavage.23,25,40 As expected, setting the production rate of D3 at 0 replicated the results from previous studies on mutual inactivation38,41supporting patterning even without cooperative regulatory feedback in the lateral inhibition model (Figures S1B–S1G).
1388	9722452	BODY17	RESULTS	55	We simulated this model using 1600 parameter sets across a two-dimensional parameter space spanning a wide range of production rates of D (βD) and D3 (βD3) (Figure 1E and Equations (1), (2), (3), (4) in STAR methods section, and Table S1 for parameter values).
1389	9722452	BODY17	RESULTS	56	To represent multicellular interactions, a two-dimensional hexagonal cell lattice was used for each parameter set.
1390	9722452	BODY17	RESULTS	57	We plotted log(Hmax/Hmin), where Hmax and Hmin are the maximal and minimal HES1 levels in the hexagonal lattice at the steady state, respectively, as a function of βD and βD3 to observe parameters leading to lateral inhibition, or heterogeneity in HES1 level.42
1391	9722452	BODY18	RESULTS	58	The cis-inhibition model shows that when βD3> βD, HES1 heterogeneity mostly does not occur, indicating effective inhibition of cell-type bifurcation (Figure 1E).
1392	9722452	BODY18	RESULTS	59	Within the parameter regime leading to heterogeneity, βD3 also regulates the ratio of receiver (HES1high) cells and sender (HES1low) cells, with higher number of sender cells as βD3 increases (Figure 1F).
1393	9722452	BODY18	RESULTS	60	We next examined Hmax and Hmin separately.
1394	9722452	BODY18	RESULTS	61	Hmax consistently decreases as βD3 increases (Figure 1G).
1395	9722452	BODY18	RESULTS	62	Of interest, a large region of parameter space shows higher Hmin with increasing DLL3 (Figures 1H and 1I).
1396	9722452	BODY18	RESULTS	63	Hmin increases throughout the parameter regime that leads to heterogeneity, peaking near βD3 = βD, and gradually decreases as βD3further increases (Figure 1H).
1397	9722452	BODY19	RESULTS	64	In this system, our mathematical modeling suggests that the influence of DLL3 on the heterogeneity of HES1 level depends on the level of DLL3 expression.
1398	9722452	BODY19	RESULTS	65	At high levels (βD3>> βD), DLL3 inhibits both heterogeneity and Notch activation.
1399	9722452	BODY19	RESULTS	66	At lower levels, however, DLL3 allows trans-interaction between NOTCH and other DLLs while preventing lateral inhibition, which leads to homogeneous intermediate NOTCH activation throughout the cell population.
1400	9722452	BODY19	RESULTS	67	In the parameter space leading to heterogeneity, DLL3 expression also affects sparsity of the receiver cells.
1401	9722452	BODY20	RESULTS	68	Given that differences in DLL3 expression level may contribute to intratumoral heterogeneity via NOTCH-driven patterning, we sought to examine whether DLL3 levels in tumors were related to the amount of NOTCH signaling or intratumoral heterogeneity present in vivo.
1402	9722452	BODY20	RESULTS	69	To do this, we first developed a new tool to detect DLL3 in tumors in vivo.
1403	9722452	BODY21	RESULTS	70	Single-chain fragment variables (scFvs) have several advantages over antibodies, including their small size and their ease of production in bacteria.43,44 We generated a His-tagged scFv based on the sequence of an antibody targeting DLL3 (Methods) (Figures 2A and S2A).
1404	9722452	BODY21	RESULTS	71	We first tested the binding of this scFv targeting DLL3 in 293T cells expressing exogenous DLL3 compared to controls.
1405	9722452	BODY21	RESULTS	72	Flow cytometry analysis using an anti-His antibody showed increased binding in cells expressing mouse DLL3 (Figures 2B and 2C).
1406	9722452	BODY21	RESULTS	73	Using the same approach, we were also able to detect endogenous DLL3 expression in human SCLC cell lines (Figures 2C and S2B).
1407	9722452	BODY21	RESULTS	74	Thus, this scFv targeting DLL3 is capable of binding to DLL3 expressed on the surface of SCLC cells in culture.

1416	9722452	BODY32	RESULTS	83	To determine if this scFv molecule (aDLL3scFv) could be useful to detect SCLC tumors in vivo, we directly labeled the amino groups of lysine residues and the N-terminal group of the aDLL3scFv with Alexa Fluor 680 (AF680), a near-infrared fluorophore with strong tissue penetration that is suitable for in vivo imaging (Figure 2D).
1417	9722452	BODY32	RESULTS	84	We first verified that the AF680-labeled aDLL3scFv (aDLL3AF680) still detected DLL3 on the surface of 293T cells expressing exogenous DLL3 as well as SCLC cells in culture (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2C).
1418	9722452	BODY32	RESULTS	85	Noninvasive optical imaging was performed over a 6-h time period following tail-vein injections with 2 nmol of aDLL3AF680 in NSG mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts (H82 model).
1419	9722452	BODY32	RESULTS	86	Whole-body fluorescent imaging showed prominent signal in the tumor area, as well as in the kidney (where the scFv molecules are excreted) 2–3 h post injection (Figures 2G and 2H).
1420	9722452	BODY32	RESULTS	87	Maximum tumor-to-normal tissue contrast was observed 2 h post injection (Figure S2D).
1421	9722452	BODY32	RESULTS	88	Signal from the fluorescent scFv was strong after 1 h and started to decrease after 3–4 h, as expected for a small molecule with a short half-life (Figure 2G).
1422	9722452	BODY33	RESULTS	89	Notch signaling is a driver of non-neuroendocrine cell fates and intratumoral heterogeneity in SCLC,12,17 and our mathematical modeling predicts that DLL3 may contribute to Notch signaling activity and may modulate heterogeneity.
1423	9722452	BODY33	RESULTS	90	We next sought to test this idea experimentally in the RPR2 mouse model of SCLC where this heterogeneity has been described.12,16 In this model, intra-tracheal instillation of an adenoviral vector expressing the Cre recombinase initiates tumors modeling the SCLC-A subtype of human SCLC.
1424	9722452	BODY33	RESULTS	91	SCLC cells in these tumors express DLL3 at their surface (Figure S3A).
1425	9722452	BODY34	RESULTS	92	To manipulate DLL3 levels in this model, we generated a new allele to conditionally induce DLL3 expression upon Cre-mediated recombination (Rosa26LSL-Dll3 allele) (Figure 3A).
1426	9722452	BODY34	RESULTS	93	We crossed this allele to the RPR2 model (RPR2;Rosa26LSL-Dll3 mice) and initiated tumors by Ad-CMV-Cre instillation.
1427	9722452	BODY34	RESULTS	94	As controls, we used RPR2;Rosa26LSL-Luc mice.45 Tumors developed in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 mice, and their histology was indistinguishable from that of RPR2;Rosa26Luc mice; whereas we did not generate enough mice to rigorously quantify tumor number and tumor burden, we did not observe any striking difference in tumor development between the two models (Figure 3B).
1428	9722452	BODY34	RESULTS	95	A cell line derived from a RPR2;Rosa26Dll3mutant lung tumor grew as spherical clusters in suspension typical of neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines12 and showed weak but detectable expression of the tdTomato reporter linked to DLL3 expression, as well as the expected recombination of the Lox-STOP-Lox cassette, validating the new allele (Figures 3A, S3B, and S3C).

1435	9722452	BODY45	RESULTS	102	We analyzed tumors from RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 and RPR2;Rosa26Lucmutant mice ∼5–6 months after tumor initiation for DLL3 expression using aDLL3scFv.
1436	9722452	BODY45	RESULTS	103	In control RPR2;Rosa26Luc tumors, we observed two populations of cancer cells, as would be expected for tumors with neuroendocrine (high DLL3) and less/non-neuroendocrine (low DLL3) cells (Figures 3C and 3D).
1437	9722452	BODY45	RESULTS	104	We validated this using NCAM and ICAM staining, with NCAMhigh ICAMlow cells representing neuroendocrine cells and NCAMlow ICAMhigh cells representing less/non-neuroendocrine, as validated previously by RNA-sequencing of these two populations from RPR2 tumors16 (Figures 3E and 3F).
1438	9722452	BODY45	RESULTS	105	In RPR2;Rosa26Dll3mutant tumors, we observed fewer cells with low levels of DLL3 and a more homogeneous population of cells expressing intermediate/high levels of DLL3 (Figures 3C and 3D), indicating that the Rosa26Dll3 allele can elevate DLL3 expression on the surface of DLL3low cells but does not result in further overexpression on the surface of DLL3high cells (Figures 3C and 3D).
1439	9722452	BODY45	RESULTS	106	Similarly, although NCAMhigh ICAMlow cells express higher level of DLL3 compared to NCAMlow ICAMhigh, no significant difference was detected between those of NCAMhigh ICAMlow cells and cells from RPR2;Rosa26Dll3mutant tumors (Figures 3E and3F).
1440	9722452	BODY46	RESULTS	107	We next quantified HES1 expression as a marker of intratumoral heterogeneity in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 and RPR2;Rosa26Lucmutant tumors, with HES1high cells being Notch-active and less/non-neuroendocrine.
1441	9722452	BODY46	RESULTS	108	As expected, we found regions with variable numbers of HES1-positive cells12,16 (Figure S3D).
1442	9722452	BODY46	RESULTS	109	However, we did not detect any significant change in heterogeneity based on this marker between the two groups (Figure S3E).
1443	9722452	BODY46	RESULTS	110	Although these experiments indicate that higher levels of DLL3 in tumors do not block the ability of SCLC cells to undergo a transition to a NOTCH-driven HES1-positive state, we reasoned that immunostaining may not be quantitative enough to identify more subtle changes.
1444	9722452	BODY47	RESULTS	111	We used flow cytometry to compare the expression of NCAM and ICAM in primary lung tumors from RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 and RPR2;Rosa26Luc mice (Figure 3G).
1445	9722452	BODY47	RESULTS	112	Compared to RPR2;Rosa26Luc tumors, we found that RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors exhibited a significant decrease in the NCAMlow ICAMhigh non-neuroendocrine population with no significant change in the NCAMhigh ICAMlow neuroendocrine population (Figures 3G–3I).
1446	9722452	BODY47	RESULTS	113	The change in the NCAMlow ICAMhigh population was reflected by an increase in NCAMlow ICAMlow cells in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors (Figures 3G and 3J).
1447	9722452	BODY48	RESULTS	114	The relatively homogeneous population in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors suggests that higher expression of DLL3 in SCLC cells can inhibit the cell-fate bifurcation process mediated by the Notch signaling pathway.
1448	9722452	BODY48	RESULTS	115	These observations support a model in which DLL3 contributes to Notch signaling activity in SCLC in vivo.
1449	9722452	BODY49	CONCLUSIONS	116	Here we investigated the role of the atypical NOTCH ligand DLL3 in a mouse model of SCLC.
1450	9722452	BODY49	CONCLUSIONS	117	In our three-pronged approach, we combined mathematical modeling, a new scFv molecule that binds DLL3, and a new allele to induce DLL3 expression in mouse cells.
1451	9722452	BODY49	CONCLUSIONS	118	We found that DLL3 expression contributes to the generation of specific subpopulations of SCLC cells, supporting a role for DLL3 in Notch signaling and in the control of intratumoral heterogeneity in SCLC.
1452	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	119	The Notch pathway is a highly conserved signaling mechanism implicated in both normal development and the progression of various cancer types.
1453	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	120	In different tissues, Notch signaling provides a binary fate switch through a biochemical feedback mechanism known as lateral inhibition, which regulates differentiation into different cell types from an initially homogeneous field of cells (reviewed in46,47).
1454	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	121	Thus, the Notch signaling pathway promotes cell fate “bifurcation” rather than a specific cell fate.
1455	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	122	This contribution of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition to intratumoral heterogeneity has been investigated extensively in multiple settings, including breast cancer,48 glioblastoma,49 and bladder cancer.50 To examine a potential role of the atypical NOTCH ligand DLL3 in SCLC in the classical Notch signaling circuit, we incorporated DLL3 in the lateral inhibition model with a mutual inactivation model.
1456	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	123	Our mathematical modeling predicts that DLL3 expression can affect Notch signaling in several ways.
1457	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	124	As expected, when the production rate of DLL3 exceeds that of DLL1 (βD3> βD) heterogeneity sharply decreases, indicating that DLL3 effectively reduces lateral inhibition.
1458	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	125	Within the parameter regime of heterogeneity, DLL3 expression modulates the relative number of HES1pos cells, making them sparser with increased DLL3 expression.
1459	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	126	Of interest, although very high production rates of DLL3 (βD3≫ βD) lead to inhibition of Notch activation in the entire population, over a wide range of parameters DLL3 expression maintains an intermediate level of Notch activation, which peaks near βD3 = βD.
1460	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	127	This observation reflects two seemingly opposing effects on Notch signaling.
1461	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	128	Low levels of DLL3 are sufficient to inhibit lateral inhibition, reducing or preventing the rise of HES1low cells.
1462	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	129	At very high levels, DLL3 inhibits Notch activation entirely through complete cis-inhibition.
1463	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	130	In between these two states, the trans-activation of Notch by DLL1 reinforces intermediate Notch activity, even within the parameter regime that leads to the homogeneous state.
1464	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	131	Thus, in the context of SCLC, our theoretical framework predicts that although high levels of DLL3 promote the HES1low phenotype (neuroendocrine), at lower levels they can lead to a hybrid phenotype that is neither HES1low nor HES1high.
1465	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	132	When we examined the role of DLL3 experimentally in these processes, we found that ectopic expression of DLL3 in HES1pos cells results in decreased HES1 expression, supportive of a cis-inhibitory function for DLL3.
1466	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	133	It is worth noting however, that the presence of DLL3 at the cell surface of SCLC cells could also in theory result in effects in trans on Notch signaling.
1467	9722452	BODY50	CONCLUSIONS	134	This has not been described yet but should be the focus of future work, as it may affect our model and the interpretation of our experiments, as well as our general understanding of the Notch pathway.
1468	9722452	BODY51	CONCLUSIONS	135	Intriguingly, induction of DLL3 in a mouse model of SCLC revealed that this ectopic expression decreases the relative number of cells in the non-neuroendocrine (NCAMlow ICAMhigh) population and increases that of a NCAMlow ICAMlow population, without significantly altering the neuroendocrine (NCAMhigh ICAMlow) population of cancer cells.
1469	9722452	BODY51	CONCLUSIONS	136	This result suggests that DLL3 inhibits the bifurcation of SCLC cell fates.
1470	9722452	BODY51	CONCLUSIONS	137	In future studies, it will be interesting to examine the exact nature of the NCAMlow ICAMlow population in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors, such as whether these cells represent a precursor cell similar to lung epithelial cells during early lung development before Notch signaling is activated or another population of non-NE cells that do not require Notch.51 Our new mouse allele for DLL3 expression may also be useful in the future to investigate how DLL3 plays Notch-dependent and Notch-independent roles both in developmental processes and in cancer.
1471	9722452	BODY52	CONCLUSIONS	138	The “fit-for-purpose” approach for biomarker assays is a useful way to think how such biomarkers assays should be tailored to the intended use of the data generated by these assays.52,53 In the case of DLL3, because several therapeutic approaches currently in clinical development rely on the expression of DLL3 on SCLC cells, validating DLL3 expression at the surface of cancer cells before and during treatment could benefit patients with SCLC.
1472	9722452	BODY52	CONCLUSIONS	139	Precise monitoring of DLL3 levels in SCLC cells could be used to track overall progression of SCLC and, as our data suggest, heterogeneity between SCLC cell subpopulations.
1473	9722452	BODY52	CONCLUSIONS	140	PET imaging of DLL3 has been evaluated clinically using DLL3 targeting antibodies with promising results.54 However, slow normal tissue clearance and requirement of radioisotopes with long half-lives hamper clinical application of antibodies as noninvasive imaging agents.55 Here, we generated an anti-DLL3 scFv (∼1/8th the size of an antibody) labeled with a fluorophore (aDLL3AF680) with tissue penetration, allowing noninvasive optical imaging.
1474	9722452	BODY52	CONCLUSIONS	141	aDLL3AF680 successfully labeled SCLC tumors in vivo with good tumor-to-normal tissue contrast in a short time frame (2 h post injection).
1475	9722452	BODY52	CONCLUSIONS	142	Fast clearance may lead to a superior imaging agent for clinical application.
1476	9722452	BODY52	CONCLUSIONS	143	Small size may allow better tissue penetration.
1477	9722452	BODY52	CONCLUSIONS	144	Thus, scFv DLL3 binder may be a great alternative to full-length antibodies for in vivo detection and targeting of DLL3 in SCLC and other tumor types expressing this molecule on their surface.
1478	9722452	BODY53	CONCLUSIONS	145	In conclusion, our modeling and experimental data point to a role for DLL3 in the regulation of Notch signaling in SCLC.
1479	9722452	BODY53	CONCLUSIONS	146	One implication of our work relates to the outcome of patients treated with therapies targeting DLL3.
1480	9722452	BODY53	CONCLUSIONS	147	It is very likely that SCLC tumors may evolve to stop expressing DLL3 as a mechanism of resistance to these therapies.
1481	9722452	BODY53	CONCLUSIONS	148	Although we have not performed loss-of-function experiments in mice, loss of DLL3 may, similarly to its overexpression, alter the identity of populations of SCLC cells in tumors.
1482	9722452	BODY53	CONCLUSIONS	149	This may in turn lead to a specific new round of therapy, with neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells responding differently to different therapies, including immunotherapies activating T cells.56,57 DLL3 remains a promising target in SCLC and other small cell neuroendocrine tumors,28,58,59,60,61,62 which warrants further studies of the biology of this molecule in normal and cancer cells.
1483	9722452	BODY54	CONCLUSIONS	150	Our mathematical modeling of the role of DLL3 in SCLC heterogeneity is limited to two dimensions, and it will be important in the future to model and investigate DLL3 in three-dimensional models, where cell-cell interactions are more similar to a tumor context.
1484	9722452	BODY54	CONCLUSIONS	151	Our analyses of mice with ectopic expression of DLL3 have been limited to one time point during the tumorigenic process, and it is possible that the role of DLL3 may be different at other time points or during/after therapy.
1485	9722452	BODY54	CONCLUSIONS	152	Recent studies have identified multiple subtypes of SCLC driven by transcriptional regulators such as ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and others.
1486	9722452	BODY54	CONCLUSIONS	153	For a comprehensive examination of how the Notch signaling pathway regulates SCLC heterogeneity, further classification and characterization involving more subtypes will be required.

1573	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine plasticity supports small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumorigenesis and promotes immunogenicity.
1574	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	Approximately 20–25% of SCLCs harbor loss of function (LOF) NOTCH mutations.
1575	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	Previous studies demonstrated that NOTCH functions as a SCLC tumor suppressor, but can also drive non-neuroendocrine plasticity to support SCLC growth.
1576	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Given the dual functionality of NOTCH, it’s not understood why SCLCs select for LOF NOTCH mutations and how these mutations impact SCLC tumorigenesis.
1577	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	In a CRISPR-based genetically-engineered mouse model of SCLC, genetic loss of Notch1 or Notch2 modestly accelerated SCLC tumorigenesis.
1578	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	Interestingly, Notch-mutant SCLCs still formed non-neuroendocrine subpopulations, and these Notch-independent, non-neuroendocrine subpopulations were driven by Runx2-mediated regulation of Rest.
1579	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	7	Notch2-mutant non-neuroendocrine cells highly express innate immune signaling genes including STING and were sensitive to STING agonists.
1580	8770597	ABS0	ABSTRACT	8	This work identifies a Notch-independent mechanism to promote non-neuroendocrine plasticity and suggests that therapeutic approaches to activate STING could be selectively beneficial for SCLCs with NOTCH2 mutations.
1581	9534498	TITLE	TITLE	0	POU2AF2/C11orf53 functions as a coactivator of POU2F3 by maintaining chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity
1582	9534498	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), accounting for around 13% of all lung cancers, often results in rapid tumor growth, early metastasis, and acquired therapeutic resistance.
1583	9534498	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	The POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3) is a master regulator of tuft cell identity and defines the SCLC-P subtype that lacks the neuroendocrine markers.
1584	9534498	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	Here, we have identified a previously uncharacterized protein, C11orf53, which is coexpressed with POU2F3 in both SCLC cell lines and patient samples.
1585	9534498	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Mechanistically, C11orf53 directly interacts with POU2F3 and is recruited to chromatin by POU2F3.
1586	9534498	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	Depletion of C11orf53 reduced enhancer H3K27ac levels and chromatin accessibility, resulting in a reduction of POU2F3-dependent gene expression.
1587	9534498	ABS0	ABSTRACT	6	On the basis of the molecular function of C11orf53, we renamed it as “POU Class 2 Homeobox Associating Factor 2” (POU2AF2).
1588	9534498	ABS0	ABSTRACT	7	In summary, our study has identified a new coactivator of POU2F3 and sheds light on the therapeutic potential of targeting POU2AF2/POU2F3 heterodimer in human SCLC.
1589	9534498	ABS1	ABSTRACT	8	C11orf53 is a new coactivator of POU2F3 that is critical for enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, and SCLC cell viability.
1590	9534498	BODY0	BACKGROUND	9	Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide (1).
1591	9534498	BODY0	BACKGROUND	10	Specifically, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and lethal form of malignancy that develops within tissues of the lungs and is typically diagnosed at later stages when it has already metastasized (2–4).
1592	9534498	BODY0	BACKGROUND	11	Although SCLC consists of approximately 13% of all lung cancer cases, it has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates and a very poor prognosis (5).
1593	9534498	BODY1	BACKGROUND	12	Recent studies have made advancements in the classification of SCLC defined by relative expression of four major molecular subtypes of key lineage-specific transcription and cotranscription regulators: achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1; SCLC-A), neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1; SCLC-N), yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1; SCLC-Y), and POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3; SCLC-P) (6).
1594	9534498	BODY1	BACKGROUND	13	Analysis of the morphological features have further indicated that SCLC can be classified into neuroendocrine (NE)–high (SCLC-A and SCLC-N) or NE-low (SCLC-Y and SCLC-P) subtypes on the basis of the expression pattern of different NE markers and the diversity in genetic alterations, growth properties, and immune infiltration (7–10).
1595	9534498	BODY2	BACKGROUND	14	Previously, we have identified an essential epigenetic coregulator and biomarker, additional sex combs-like protein 3 (ASXL3), which is associated with the SCLC-A molecular subtype.
1596	9534498	BODY2	BACKGROUND	15	ASXL3 functions as a scaffold protein that links histone H2A deubiquitinase BAP1 and the bromodomain-containing protein BRD4 at active enhancer and drives lineage-specific transcriptional programming (11).
1597	9534498	BODY2	BACKGROUND	16	Therefore, our study suggested that it is necessary to globally identify and study these subtype-specific essential factors to gain a more in-depth understanding of underlying mechanisms regulating SCLC tumorigenesis that may potentially assist in treatment decisions for SCLC and create a much-needed individualized strategic approach.
1598	9534498	BODY3	BACKGROUND	17	For instance, the SCLC-P subtype, which is defined by the expression of a master transcription factor, POU2F3, is known to be a variant form of SCLC that lacks NE features (12).
1599	9534498	BODY3	BACKGROUND	18	However, identifying other contributing factors in the progression of SCLC-P, specifically a cofactor of POU2F3 function, has yet to be determined.
1600	9534498	BODY3	BACKGROUND	19	Through our current dependency data analysis and subsequent biochemical and genetic studies, we have identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C11orf53, as a codependent gene of POU2F3.
1601	9534498	BODY3	BACKGROUND	20	In these studies, we have comprehensively uncovered an essential role of C11orf53 as a coactivator of POU2F3 in regulatory gene expression to establish the cell identity of the SCLC-P subtype.
1602	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	21	Global gene expression profiling has been widely used to define molecular subtypes in human cancers (13, 14), including lung cancer (6).
1603	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	22	However, not all highly expressed genes are essential for tumor cell growth or cell viability.
1604	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	23	Therefore, to identify the functional subtype-specific dependent factor within the four SCLC molecular subtypes, we used Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) SCLC cell lines (15) encompassing all four subtypes (6) defined previously and explored the genes that are most selectively essential to each subtype compared to the other classifications.
1605	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	24	Following the criteria for target gene effect score (≤−0.5; median difference <0.2 versus median value of the average of all other groups), we identified 48 genes for SCLC-A, 88 genes for SCLC-N, 66 genes for SCLC-P, and 177 genes for SCLC-Y subtypes defined as being selectively essential in each SCLC subtype (Fig. 1A and table S1).
1606	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	25	The expression levels of these genes were compared with no global up- or down-regulation in each subgroup (fig. S1A).
1607	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	26	The essential genes in each subtype are enriched in distinct pathways (Fig. 1B), suggesting that each subtype may depend on a unique set of signaling pathways for cell survivability and proliferation.
1608	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	27	Next, we highlighted the top genes that are essential or redundant in each subtype (Fig. 1C), revealing the nonoverlapping essentiality profiles in these subtypes.
1609	9534498	BODY4	RESULTS	28	The gene effect scores of the four markers—ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1—showed the selective dependency (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with previous studies for the function of each gene.
1610	9534498	BODY6	RESULTS	29	Previous studies have identified that the transcription factor POU2F3 is a master regulator of a tuft cell–like variant of small cell lung cancer (12).
1611	9534498	BODY6	RESULTS	30	Therefore, POU2F3 has been widely used to define the SCLC-P subtype.
1612	9534498	BODY6	RESULTS	31	On the basis of our dependency data analysis in Fig.
1613	9534498	BODY6	RESULTS	32	1A, we noted that the gene dependency score related to a gene called chromosome 11 open reading frame 53 (C11orf53; fig. S2A) is selectively higher in rank (1 of 66) versus POU2F3 (2 of 66) in its significance to maintain the integrity of SCLC-P subtype (Fig. 2A).
1614	9534498	BODY6	RESULTS	33	C11orf53 is an uncharacterized gene that is an evolutionarily conserved sequence from zebrafish to human (fig. S2, B and C) and is expressed at high levels in all four SCLC-P cell lines examined (fig. S2D).
1615	9534498	BODY8	RESULTS	34	The C11orf53 gene encodes for a 288–amino acid protein product without any known functional domain/motif or cellular localization signal.
1616	9534498	BODY8	RESULTS	35	When analyzing the codependency scores of top genes that are selectively essential in SCLC-P subtype, POU2F3 and C11orf53 have an overall correlation coefficient of 0.812 in the SCLC-P subtype compared to 0.357 in all 17 SCLC cell lines (Fig. 2B).
1617	9534498	BODY8	RESULTS	36	This prompted us to investigate the functional relationship between C11orf53 and POU2F3 in P-subtype SCLC.
1618	9534498	BODY8	RESULTS	37	In published SCLC patient samples (EGAS00001000925), we have detected a strongly positive correlation between the expression levels of POU2F3 and C11orf53 (Fig. 2C).
1619	9534498	BODY8	RESULTS	38	Therefore, this gene may function as a new biomarker for SCLC-P subtype cells.
1620	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	39	To study the function of C11orf53 in SCLC cells, we generated our homemade polyclonal antibody for C11orf53 (fig. S2E) and detected the protein levels of C11orf53 in four different SCLC cell lines.
1621	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	40	As shown in Fig. 2D, we have detected very high levels of C11orf53 protein in the NCI-H526 and NCI-H211 SCLC-P subtype cell lines.
1622	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	41	In contrast, there were no detectable signals from NCI-H510 nor NCI-H1963 non–SCLC-P subtype cell lines.
1623	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	42	Genetic depletion of C11orf53 by two distinct CRISPR single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in SCLC cells markedly reduced cell viability (Fig. 2, E and F).
1624	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	43	To further determine how this gene contributes to cell viability, we examined the protein levels of several factors involved in both cell cycle regulatory checkpoints and apoptosis from two different SCLC-P cell lines.
1625	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	44	As shown in Fig. 2G, in both SCLC-P cell lines, we found that genetic depletion of C11orf53 via CRISPR knockout could induce cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase 3, and caspase 7.
1626	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	45	In addition, loss of C11orf53 protein also induces a notable cell cycle arrest, as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in NCI-H526 cells (fig. S2F).
1627	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	46	In summary, our results suggest that the C11orf53 gene is critical for the maintenance of SCLC-P cell viability.
1628	9534498	BODY9	RESULTS	47	Consistent with the in vitro cell growth results, genetic depletion of C11orf53 in the in vivo xenograft model significantly repressed tumor growth (P = 0.0033; Fig. 2H) and delayed further progression of disease in mice (P = 0.0023; Fig. 2I).
1629	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	48	To understand how C11orf53 globally affects gene expression in SCLC cells, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in the NCI-H526 cell line transduced with either nontargeting CRISPR sgRNA or two distinct C11orf53-specific sgRNAs.
1630	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	49	As shown in Fig.
1631	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	50	3A, we found a total of 3719 and 3259 genes that were significantly down- and up-regulated, respectively, upon genetic depletion of C11orf53.
1632	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	51	Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) pathway analysis had identified several key cellular growth biological processes, such as Myc and E2F signaling pathway–dependent gene signatures, which were markedly down-regulated upon genetic depletion of C11orf53 (Fig. 3B).
1633	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	52	To understand how this small protein regulates gene expression, we first sought to determine the cellular localization of C11orf53 by cell fractionation assay.
1634	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	53	Unexpectedly, we found that the C11orf53 protein could be detected in the cytosol, soluble nuclear, and chromatin (insoluble nuclear) fractions (Fig. 3C), although it obviously has no nuclear localization signal.
1635	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	54	To further investigate how this protein regulates gene expression at the chromatin, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) with two of our homemade polyclonal antibodies.
1636	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	55	On the basis of our ChIP-seq analysis, both of our antibodies showed a consistent performance and the peaks are highly correlated (fig. S3, A and B).
1637	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	56	In general, we have detected 8820 C11orf53-specific peaks in NCI-H526 cells (Fig. 3D).
1638	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	57	We found that most of these peaks were localized at intergenic or intron regions, indicating that C11orf53 may regulate gene expression at distal enhancer elements.
1639	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	58	In addition, the motif analysis has identified POU2F3 motif being matched the top hit (P value, 1 × 10−3053) at C11orf53 peaks (Fig. 3E).
1640	9534498	BODY10	RESULTS	59	This result implies that there might be a similar functionality or genetic interaction between POU2F3 and C11orf53 within SCLC-P subtype cells.
1641	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	60	To further characterize the function of C11orf53 at the genome-wide scale and understand how C11orf53 regulates gene expression at distal enhancers, we divided all C11orf53 peaks into four clusters based on k-means clustering.
1642	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	61	As shown in Fig.
1643	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	62	3F, we have detected a very significant overlap between enhancer marker H3K4me1 and C11orf53 peaks.
1644	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	63	Both of cluster 1 and 2 peaks are also enriched with active enhancer marker H3K27ac, suggesting that C11orf53 may function as a transcriptional activator at active enhancers.
1645	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	64	We further integrated our RNA-seq data with the ChIP-seq data and identified the expression change of the genes that are nearest to C11orf53 peaks (table S2).
1646	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	65	As shown in the middle panel of Fig.
1647	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	66	3F and fig. S3C, we found that genes nearest to cluster 1 peaks are markedly reduced upon C11orf53 depletion, where very broad H3K4me1 peaks were detected.
1648	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	67	As shown in Fig.
1649	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	68	3G, most of the super enhancer (SE)–associated genes (table S3) are reduced after C11orf53 depletion.
1650	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	69	In general, around 66% (71 of 108) SE-associated genes are occupied by C11orf53 (table S4), in which 73.2% (52 of 71) genes were down-regulated upon C11orf53 depletion (fig. S3D).
1651	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	70	Pathway analysis with genes nearest to cluster 1 peaks show a significant enrichment in several neuronal function and differentiation pathways (fig. S3E).
1652	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	71	Next, to further confirm the role of C11orf53 involvement in regulating SE-associated genes, we determined the gene expression profiles within cells treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide or JQ1 (table S5).
1653	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	72	As shown in the right panel of Fig.
1654	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	73	3 (F and G) and fig. S3 (F to I), the JQ1 treatment has induced a very similar change in the gene expression profile as C11orf53 depletion.
1655	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	74	The SCLC-P subtype cells are tuft cell–like variant of small cell lung cancer, which express tuft cell–like specific markers, such as SOX9, GFI1B, and PTGS1.
1656	9534498	BODY12	RESULTS	75	Notably, these tuft cell–like specific genes were down-regulated after C11orf53 depletion or JQ1 treatment (Fig. 3H and fig. S3J).
1657	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	76	Because C11orf53 occupies active enhancers and is critical for maintenance in the expression levels of the enhancer-nearby genes, we asked whether loss of C11orf53 affects the protein levels of enhancer histone marks, such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.
1658	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	77	We conducted Western blot in cells transduced with either nontargeting CRISPR sgRNA or two distinct C11orf53 sgRNAs.
1659	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	78	As a result, we found that loss of C11orf53 expression does not affect the bulk of histone modifications (Fig. 4A).
1660	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	79	Next, we conducted ChIP-seq to determine whether there were locus-specific changes in active enhancer marks (H3K4me1/H3K27ac levels).
1661	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	80	As shown in Fig.
1662	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	81	4 (B and C), C11orf53 genetic depletion strongly reduced H3K27ac levels and a moderate reduction in H3K4me1 levels.
1663	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	82	Then, we centered the log2 fold change of H3K4me1/H3K27ac levels at the previously defined four C11orf53-specific clusters in Fig.
1664	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	83	3F.
1665	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	84	As shown in Fig.
1666	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	85	4D, we have detected a very strong reduction of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 histone marks near C11orf53 peaks.
1667	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	86	Consistently, there is also a marked reduction of SE signals in C11orf53-depleted cells (Fig. 4, E and F).
1668	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	87	Last, we conducted transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) experiments to determine whether the chromatin accessibility has been altered in C11orf53-depleted cells.
1669	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	88	As a result, we have detected a total of 55,111 ATAC-seq peaks with 7805 of those peaks being occupied by C11orf53 (Fig. 4G).
1670	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	89	We further separated the total ATAC-seq peaks into two groups, depending on whether they were cobound with C11orf53 or not.
1671	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	90	As shown in Fig.
1672	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	91	4H, we found that group 1 peaks (ATAC-seq+/C11orf53+) were strongly reduced upon both sgRNA treatments [Fig. 4, H (left) and I, and fig. S4, A and B], while group 2 peaks (ATAC-seq+/C11orf53−) were not significantly reduced upon C11orf53 genetic depletion (Fig. 4H, right, and fig. S4C).
1673	9534498	BODY13	RESULTS	92	In summary, our results have shown a novel function of C11orf53 involved in chromatin accessibility and maintenance of enhancer-driven transcriptional program in SCLC-P subtype cells.
1674	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	93	As an uncharacterized 288–amino acid protein, there is no obvious functional domain/motif within C11orf53.
1675	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	94	To study the underlying molecular basis of how C11orf53 is recruited to chromatin and regulates gene expression, we purified green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged proteins from SCLC cell line NCI-H526 that stably express either GFP or GFP-tagged C11orf53.
1676	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	95	By mass spectrometry analysis, we found POU2F3 as one of the top candidates that interacted with C11orf53 (Fig. 5, A and B).
1677	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	96	We further performed IP experiments with whole-cell lysate from NCI-H526 cells (Fig. 5, C and D) and NCI-H211 cells (fig. S5, A and B) to confirm the protein-protein interaction between the endogenous C11orf53 and POU2F3.
1678	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	97	To understand how C11orf53 interacts with POU2F3, we truncated POU2F3 into several different truncated fragments (Fig. 5E) and purified each of these GFP-tagged fragments in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells cotransfected with Halo-tagged C11orf53 (Fig. 5F).
1679	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	98	As shown in Fig.
1680	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	99	5G, we found that the POU domain within the POU2F3 protein is critical for the interaction with C11orf53.
1681	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	100	To determine a potential cofunction between C11orf53 and POU2F3, we conducted ChIP-seq to determine the chromatin occupancy of POU2F3 in NCI-H526 cells.
1682	9534498	BODY15	RESULTS	101	As we expected, there is a significant overlap between POU2F3 and C11orf53 occupancy across the genome in both NCI-H526 [Fig. 5, H (left) and I, and fig. S5F] and NCI-H211 (fig. S5, C to E and G) cells.
1683	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	102	Because C11orf53 protein has no known DNA or histone binding domain, we hypothesized that it may be transported into the nuclei and recruited to chromatin by POU2F3.
1684	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	103	To test this hypothesis, we transfected HEK293T cells (which express neither POU2F3 nor C11orf53) with Halo-tag or Halo-tagged POU2F3 in the presence of GFP-tagged C11orf53.
1685	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	104	As shown in fig.
1686	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	105	S6 (A and B), the chromatin bound C11orf53 was markedly increased in the presence of POU2F3, as determined by Western blot and ChIP-seq results.
1687	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	106	To confirm this observation in SCLC cells, we depleted POU2F3 by CRISPR knockout in NCI-H526 cells for 2 days and determined the chromatin-bound C11orf53 levels.
1688	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	107	As shown in fig.
1689	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	108	S6 (C and D), genetic depletion of POU2F3 could also reduce the chromatin-bound C11orf53, as determined by Western blot and ChIP–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results.
1690	9534498	BODY17	RESULTS	109	These results imply that C11orf53 might function as a coactivator that is recruited to chromatin by POU2F3 (16).
1691	9534498	BODY18	RESULTS	110	In NCI-H526 cells, POU2F3 genetic depletion reduced the expression of group 1–clustered genes, which is similar compared to C11orf53 genetic depletion (Fig. 5H, right, and table S6).
1692	9534498	BODY18	RESULTS	111	In total, there are 327 genes that are co–down-regulated by C11orf53 or POU2F3 genetic depletion (fold change >2), in which we have identified numerous tuft cell lineage genes—which has been demonstrated to be targeted genes of POU2F3 (Fig. 5J and fig. S6E).
1693	9534498	BODY18	RESULTS	112	Because the chromatin binding motif between C11orf53 and POU2F3 is extremely similar, we have introduced a luciferase assay to further confirm the cofunction between these two factors.
1694	9534498	BODY18	RESULTS	113	As shown in Fig.
1695	9534498	BODY18	RESULTS	114	5K, we found that cotransfection of C11orf53 and POU2F3 has the strongest effect on inducing luciferase expression.
1696	9534498	BODY18	RESULTS	115	Similar to C11orf53 genetic depletion, a loss in the expression of POU2F3 also markedly induces apoptosis and reduces cell viability in two different SCLC-P cell lines (Fig. 5, L and M).
1697	9534498	BODY18	RESULTS	116	In summary, our model has shown that this previous uncharacterized protein, C11orf53, functions as a coactivator of POU2F3 and maintains chromatin accessibility at POU2F3-targeted genes in SCLC cells (Fig. 5N).
1698	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	117	The POU family proteins are a large class of DNA binding transcription factors that are divided into six classes, with POU2F3 belonging to the POU II class, which includes POU2F1 (Oct-1) and POU2F2 (Oct-2) (17).
1699	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	118	As the only known binding partner of POU II class, POU2AF1 (POU Class 2 Homeobox Associating Factor 1) functions as coactivator of POU2F1, and to a lesser extent than POU2F1, as a coactivator of POU2F2 (18–21).
1700	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	119	Our current study has provided evidence for a previously uncharacterized protein, C11orf53, functioning as a coactivator of POU2F3 (also known as Oct-11).
1701	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	120	Therefore, we are defining this gene on the basis of its novel function and classifying it as the POU Class 2 Homeobox Associating Factor 2 (or POU2AF2).
1702	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	121	On the basis of our mass spectrometry analysis of purified C11orf53, we did not detect POU2F1 or POU2F2, which are both expressed in NCI-H526 cells based on our RNA-seq data.
1703	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	122	This result suggested that C11orf53 is quite a unique coactivator of POU2F3.
1704	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	123	It is known that POU2AF1 binds to POU2F1 and POU2F2 using its α-helical segment, while C11orf53 does not display a similar structure (22).
1705	9534498	BODY19	CONCLUSIONS	124	Therefore, it would be interesting to determine the crystal structure of C11orf53 bounded to POU2F3 but also challenging because of the disordered nature of C11orf53 structure.
1706	9534498	BODY20	CONCLUSIONS	125	The function of POU2F3 in small cell lung cancer has been identified by genome-wide CRISPR screening in previous studies (12).
1707	9534498	BODY20	CONCLUSIONS	126	Therefore, it has been widely used as the biomarker that defines the SCLC-P subtype, which expresses markers of the chemosensory lineage instead of NE markers.
1708	9534498	BODY20	CONCLUSIONS	127	Mechanistically, POU2F3 binds to distal enhancer elements and drives the expression of the lineage-specific genes.
1709	9534498	BODY20	CONCLUSIONS	128	As a nonhistone/DNA binding coactivator, C11orf53 is recruited to chromatin by the DNA binding transcription factor, POU2F3, and maintains openness of the chromatin to regulate the expression of POU2F3-targeted genes.
1710	9534498	BODY20	CONCLUSIONS	129	On the basis of our model (Fig. 5N), C11orf53 may not function as a canonical pioneer factor that recruits transcription factor(s) to chromatin.
1711	9534498	BODY21	CONCLUSIONS	130	On the basis of our genome-wide RNA-seq analysis in Fig.
1712	9534498	BODY21	CONCLUSIONS	131	5J, there are approximately 32% of C11orf53-targeted genes that are not affected upon POU2F3 genetic depletion, which suggests that C11orf53 may have a POU2F3-independent function.
1713	9534498	BODY21	CONCLUSIONS	132	On the basis of our cellular fractionation assay (Fig. 3C and fig. S6C), a significant proportion of C11of53 proteins have been detected in the cytoplasm, while a vast majority of POU2F3 could only be detected in the nuclei.
1714	9534498	BODY21	CONCLUSIONS	133	Therefore, future studies may be focused on the cytoplasmic function of C11orf53 in SCLC cells.
1715	9534498	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	134	Dysregulation or mutations within enhancer binding factors have been identified as direct drivers for many types of cancers (23, 24).
1716	9534498	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	135	Our current studies have shown a critical role of C11orf53 at SEs.
1717	9534498	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	136	Consequently, loss of C11orf53 leads to a loci-specific reduction of H3K27ac levels and gene expression, which is similar to the effects of JQ1 treatment.
1718	9534498	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	137	Our result is consistent with previous reports that SCLC cells are more sensitive to BET inhibitor treatment (11, 25, 26).
1719	9534498	BODY23	CONCLUSIONS	138	In summary, our study sheds light on the potential impact of targeting C11orf53 or C11orf53/POU2F3 heterodimer for new therapeutic approaches against SCLC-P subtype because of its specificity and high dependency in this particular cancer type, which is in agreement with a recent work published by Vakoc’s group (27).Therefore, establishing small-molecule inhibitors or peptide drugs that can disrupt C11orf53/POU2F3 interaction may specifically inhibit POU2F3-dependent transcriptional programming in SCLC cells and thus aid in the development of a more personalized approach to SCLC therapy.

1774	6942053	TITLE	TITLE	0	The KDM5A/RBP2 histone demethylase represses NOTCH signaling to sustain neuroendocrine differentiation and promote small cell lung cancer tumorigenesis
1775	6942053	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	In this study from Oser et al., the authors investigated how RB1 loss causes a neuroendocrine phenotype in different tumor types.
1776	6942053	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	They show that histone demethylase KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A) promotes small cell lung cancer (SCLC) proliferation and SCLCs neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype through sustained expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1 by repressing NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes, thereby establishing a role for KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis.
1777	6942053	ABS1	ABSTRACT	3	More than 90% of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) harbor loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene RB1.
1778	6942053	ABS1	ABSTRACT	4	The canonical function of the RB1 gene product, pRB, is to repress the E2F transcription factor family, but pRB also functions to regulate cellular differentiation in part through its binding to the histone demethylase KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A).
1779	6942053	ABS1	ABSTRACT	5	We show that KDM5A promotes SCLC proliferation and SCLC's neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype in part by sustaining expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1.
1780	6942053	ABS1	ABSTRACT	6	Mechanistically, we found that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation by repressing NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes.
1781	6942053	ABS1	ABSTRACT	7	To test the role of KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis in vivo, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based mouse model of SCLC by delivering an adenovirus (or an adeno-associated virus [AAV]) that expresses Cre recombinase and sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Tp53, and Rbl2 into the lungs of Lox-Stop-Lox Cas9 mice.
1782	6942053	ABS1	ABSTRACT	8	Coinclusion of a KDM5A sgRNA decreased SCLC tumorigenesis and metastasis, and the SCLCs that formed despite the absence of KDM5A had higher NOTCH activity compared to KDM5A+/+ SCLCs.
1783	6942053	ABS1	ABSTRACT	9	This work establishes a role for KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis and suggests that KDM5 inhibitors should be explored as treatments for SCLC.
1784	6942053	BODY0	BACKGROUND	10	Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) are high-grade neuroendocrine tumors that account for ∼15% of lung cancers (Kalemkerian et al. 2013).
1785	6942053	BODY0	BACKGROUND	11	Almost all SCLCs highly express either ASCL1 (in 70% of cases) or NEUROD1 (in 20% of cases) (Christensen et al. 2014; George et al. 2015; Borromeo et al. 2016), which are both neuronal/neuroendocrine lineage transcription factors (Pattyn et al. 2004; Gao et al. 2009; Chanda et al. 2014).
1786	6942053	BODY0	BACKGROUND	12	In SCLC, ASCL1 activates genes involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and lung development, as well as known SCLC proto-oncogenes such as MYCL1, NKX2.1, and SOX2 (Borromeo et al. 2016).
1787	6942053	BODY0	BACKGROUND	13	ASCL1 is required for survival in SCLC cell lines (Augustyn et al. 2014) and for tumor initiation in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC (Borromeo et al. 2016), suggesting that maintenance of the neuroendocrine differentiation state in SCLC is necessary to sustain tumor growth.
1788	6942053	BODY0	BACKGROUND	14	However, the mechanisms that drive high ASCL1 expression in SCLC are not well understood.
1789	6942053	BODY1	BACKGROUND	15	Approximately 25% of SCLCs have mutually exclusive loss of function (LOF) mutations in NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4) (George et al. 2015).
1790	6942053	BODY1	BACKGROUND	16	Reexpression of the transcriptionally active intracellular domain (ICD) of NOTCH1 (NOTCH1-ICD) or NOTCH2 (NOTCH2-ICD) slows SCLC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibits tumor formation in vivo in a SCLC GEMM (George et al. 2015), demonstrating that NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 function as tumor suppressors in SCLC.
1791	6942053	BODY1	BACKGROUND	17	Reexpression of NOTCH-ICD also dramatically decreases ASCL1 expression (George et al. 2015), suggesting that low NOTCH activity in SCLC is required to sustain ASCL1 levels and maintain neuroendocrine differentiation.
1792	6942053	BODY1	BACKGROUND	18	Interestingly, nearly 80% of human SCLCs have transcriptional signatures of low NOTCH activity and express high levels of ASCL1, irrespective of whether they harbor a NOTCH mutation (George et al. 2015).
1793	6942053	BODY1	BACKGROUND	19	This suggests that other, as yet unknown, mechanisms repress NOTCH activity in SCLC tumors that are genetically NOTCH WT.
1794	6942053	BODY2	BACKGROUND	20	SCLC is almost always linked to inactivating mutations in the RB1 and TP53 tumor suppressor genes.
1795	6942053	BODY2	BACKGROUND	21	The canonical function of the pRB pathway, which includes pRB and its upstream regulators p16, Cyclin D1, and CDK4, is to regulate cell-cycle progression by modulating E2F-dependent transcription (Dyson 2016).
1796	6942053	BODY2	BACKGROUND	22	Almost all SCLCs harbor RB1 mutations, whereas CDKN2A (p16), CCND1 (Cyclin D1), and CDK4 mutations are conspicuously rare.
1797	6942053	BODY2	BACKGROUND	23	This suggests a specific role for pRB loss in SCLC pathogenesis that is not shared by other E2F regulators.
1798	6942053	BODY3	BACKGROUND	24	Rb1 loss in the mouse leads to the development of neuroendocrine pituitary, thyroid, and retinal tumors (Jacks et al. 1992; Zhang et al. 2004).
1799	6942053	BODY3	BACKGROUND	25	Interestingly, pRB loss in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and bladder cancer has been linked to transdifferentiation to a small cell neuroendocrine phenotype (Tan et al. 2014; Niederst et al. 2015; Chang 2017; Ku et al. 2017; Mu et al. 2017), suggesting that pRB loss promotes neuroendocrine differentiation.
1800	6942053	BODY4	BACKGROUND	26	In this regard, pRB has been shown to bind and inhibit the activity of the H3K4 histone demethylase KDM5A/RBP2/JARID1A (hereafter referred to as KDM5A), and KDM5A is required for the differentiation block induced by pRB loss (i.e., KDM5A is epistatic to pRB) in cellular models (Benevolenskaya et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2011).
1801	6942053	BODY4	BACKGROUND	27	Furthermore, loss of KDM5A suppresses the growth of Rb1−/− neuroendocrine pituitary and thyroid tumors (Lin et al. 2011; McBrayer et al. 2018).
1802	6942053	BODY4	BACKGROUND	28	The role for KDM5A in neuroendocrine differentiation and SCLC tumorigenesis has been largely unexplored, although one study reported that KDM5A shRNAs slowed cellular proliferation in the SCLC cell line NCI-H446 that inherently expresses low levels of ASCL1 (Váraljai et al. 2015).
1803	6942053	BODY5	BACKGROUND	29	Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC have been developed to study SCLC tumorigenesis in vivo.
1804	6942053	BODY5	BACKGROUND	30	These models have traditionally been generated by intratracheal (IT) injection of adenoviruses encoding Cre recombinase into mice carrying homozygous floxed alleles for Rb1 and Trp53 (referred to hereafter as RP model).
1805	6942053	BODY5	BACKGROUND	31	In the RP model, SCLCs form after 1 yr (Meuwissen et al. 2003).
1806	6942053	BODY5	BACKGROUND	32	Some human SCLCs also have mutations in both RB1 and its paralog RBL2 (George et al. 2015), and SCLC tumor latency is reduced to 6 mo in mice when Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 (protein = p130) are inactivated in the lung (referred to hereafter as the RPP model) (Schaffer et al. 2010).
1807	6942053	BODY5	BACKGROUND	33	However, studying additional genetic interactions in these models is burdensome given the amount of breeding, and hence time, required to introduce additional experimental alleles (e.g., a null allele for a candidate therapeutic target gene or cooperating tumor suppressor gene).
1808	6942053	BODY6	BACKGROUND	34	A mouse strain (hereafter called LSL-Cas9 mice) that conditionally expresses Cas9 after Cre recombinase-mediated excision of a Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) cassette was recently used to make a lung adenocarcinoma GEMM (Platt et al. 2014).
1809	6942053	BODY6	BACKGROUND	35	These mice developed lung adenocarcinomas ∼2 mo after IT injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding sgRNAs against Trp53, Lkb1, and Kras together with a homologous repair template for introducing an oncogenic K-Ras mutation (Platt et al. 2014).
1810	6942053	BODY6	BACKGROUND	36	Notably, most of these tumors did not carry a K-Ras mutation and were therefore driven primarily by Trp53 and Lkb1 loss.
1811	6942053	BODY6	BACKGROUND	37	We reasoned this technology could be used to rapidly inactivate Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 in the mouse to cause SCLC and that, if successful, we could then simultaneously inactivate additional genes that might impact SCLC biology.
1812	6942053	BODY7	BACKGROUND	38	Herein, we show that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC through a NOTCH2-dependent mechanism.
1813	6942053	BODY7	BACKGROUND	39	We also describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based SCLC GEMM generated by IT injection of an adenovirus that encodes Cre and sgRNAs against Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 into LSL-Cas9 mice.
1814	6942053	BODY7	BACKGROUND	40	We used this SCLC GEMM to simultaneously deliver a Kdm5a sgRNA at tumor initiation as a means of studying Kdm5a's role in SCLC tumorigenesis.
1815	6942053	BODY8	RESULTS	41	To ask whether KDM5A promotes SCLC proliferation, we infected three different RB1−/− SCLC cell lines (GLC16, NCI-H82, and NCI-H1876) with lentiviruses that express Cas9 and one of two effective KDM5A sgRNAs (Fig. 1A,C,E).
1816	6942053	BODY8	RESULTS	42	CRISPR-mediated knockdown of KDM5A slowed cellular proliferation in all three cell lines (Fig. 1B,D,F).
1817	6942053	BODY8	RESULTS	43	These effects were likely on target because the proliferation defect in NCI-H82 cells caused by one of the KDM5A sgRNAs was reversed by expression of an sgRNA-resistant KDM5A variant (Fig. 1G,H).
1818	6942053	BODY8	RESULTS	44	Importantly, CRISPR/Cas9 screens performed in 517 cancer cell lines from Project Achilles demonstrated that KDM5A is not a common essential gene and was only found to be a dependency in six of the 558 cell lines examined (Tsherniak et al. 2017).
1819	6942053	BODY8	RESULTS	45	Together, these data show that inactivation of KDM5A inhibits SCLC proliferation in vitro.
1820	6942053	BODY10	RESULTS	46	RB1 loss causes a differentiation block in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and myocytes that is relieved by inactivation of KDM5A.
1821	6942053	BODY10	RESULTS	47	Therefore, RB1 and KDM5A are epistatic with respect to differentiation control (Benevolenskaya et al. 2005).
1822	6942053	BODY10	RESULTS	48	Since almost all SCLCs have loss-of-function RB1 mutations (Peifer et al. 2012; Rudin et al. 2012; George et al. 2015), we hypothesized that KDM5A causes a differentiation block in SCLC.
1823	6942053	BODY10	RESULTS	49	Studies with genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC using cell-type-specific promoters revealed that pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are possibly the cell of origin for most SCLCs (Sutherland et al. 2011).
1824	6942053	BODY10	RESULTS	50	Therefore, we reasoned that a differentiation block in SCLC would manifest as maintenance of its neuroendocrine phenotype, which can be measured by the presence of neuroendocrine markers such as ASCL1, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A.
1825	6942053	BODY10	RESULTS	51	To ask whether KDM5A causes a differentiation block in SCLC, we inactivated KDM5A using CRISPR/Cas9 in three different SCLC cell lines that express high levels of ASCL1 (GLC16, NCI-H1417, NCI-H1876).
1826	6942053	BODY10	RESULTS	52	KDM5A inactivation decreased the levels of the neuroendocrine lineage transcriptional activator ASCL1 as well as other neuroendocrine markers (Fig. 2A,B; Supplemental Fig. S1A).
1827	6942053	BODY12	RESULTS	53	We next asked whether pharmacological inhibition of KDM5 demethylase activity repressed ASCL1 levels in three SCLC cell lines (NCI-H69, NCI-H1876, and GLC16).
1828	6942053	BODY12	RESULTS	54	KDM5-C70, a KDM5-family demethylase inhibitor that selectively inhibits KDM5 family members (Johansson et al. 2016) and promotes H3 lysine(K) 4 trimethylation without causing accumulation of other H3 lysine methylation marks (Fig. 2C), markedly decreased ASCL1 levels in all three SCLC cell lines (Fig. 2D–F), and inhibited cellular proliferation in NCI-H1876 and NCI-H69 cells, but not in GLC16 cells (Fig. 2G–I).
1829	6942053	BODY12	RESULTS	55	Strikingly, some NCI-H69 cells, a classic-type SCLC cell line that normally grow purely as suspension cells in aggregates, adhered to tissue-culture plastic after treatment with KDM5-C70 (Fig. 2J), a phenotype that has been correlated with loss of neuroendocrine differentiation in preclinical SCLC models in vitro and in vivo (Calbo et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2017).
1830	6942053	BODY13	RESULTS	56	Both stable and inducible exogenous ASCL1 expression in NCI-H69 cells partially mitigated the antiproliferative effects of KDM5-C70, suggesting that down-regulation of endogenous ASCL1 contributes to the antiproliferative effects of KDM5-C70 (Fig. 2K,L; Supplemental Fig. S1B,C).
1831	6942053	BODY13	RESULTS	57	It should be noted that the exogenous ASCL1 levels we were able to achieve were considerably lower than endogenous ASCL1 levels in NCI-H69 cells (Fig. 2K; Supplemental Fig. S1B).
1832	6942053	BODY13	RESULTS	58	This might account for the incomplete rescue we observed, as would ASCL1-independent activities of KDM5-C70.
1833	6942053	BODY13	RESULTS	59	Further underscoring the importance of ASCL1 with respect to KDM5-C70's antiproliferative effects, ASCL1-positive SCLC subtype cell lines, but not the NEUROD1-positive SCLC subtype cell lines, were more sensitive to KDM5-C70 compared with the NSCLC cell lines examined (Supplemental Fig. S1D–H).
1834	6942053	BODY13	RESULTS	60	Together, these results demonstrate that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels in SCLC to maintain its neuroendocrine phenotype.
1835	6942053	BODY14	RESULTS	61	KDM5A is a histone demethylase that often functions to repress target genes at transcriptional start sites (Pedersen and Helin 2010).
1836	6942053	BODY14	RESULTS	62	Therefore, we reasoned that KDM5A's ability to sustain ASCL1 levels is likely an indirect effect.
1837	6942053	BODY14	RESULTS	63	To elucidate candidate target genes that are normally repressed by KDM5A to sustain ASCL1 expression, we performed an RNA-sequencing experiment with GLC16 SCLC cells treated with an sgRNA-targeting KDM5A compared with cells treated with a nontargeting sgRNA.
1838	6942053	BODY14	RESULTS	64	Consistent with our data described above (see Fig. 2), ASCL1 was among the 10 most significantly down-regulated mRNAs in the transcriptome in KDM5A knockdown cells (Fig. 3A).
1839	6942053	BODY14	RESULTS	65	Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of our RNA-sequencing data showed that cells treated with the KDM5A sgRNA had an increased H3K4 trimethylation signature compared with cells treated with nontargeting sgRNA (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with KDM5A's known function as a H3K4me3 histone demethylase.
1840	6942053	BODY14	RESULTS	66	In addition, GSEA revealed that ASCL1 targets were significantly down-regulated and mRNAs that regulate EMT were enriched in KDM5A knockdown cells (Fig. 3B), providing further evidence that KDM5A inactivation causes a loss of neuroendocrine differentiation and a change in cell state.
1841	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	67	Interestingly, NOTCH2 was the fourth most up-regulated mRNA in the entire transcriptome of cells lacking KDM5A (Fig. 3A).
1842	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	68	This was notable because NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 are tumor suppressors in SCLC and repress ASCL1 to inhibit the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype (George et al. 2015).
1843	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	69	SCLCs that express ASCL1 have low NOTCH receptor and NOTCH target gene expression irrespective of their NOTCH mutational status (Supplemental Fig. S2A; George et al. 2015).
1844	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	70	Furthermore, KDM5A interacts with RBP-J and represses the activity of the nuclear NOTCH activation complex (Liefke et al. 2010).
1845	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	71	We therefore hypothesized that KDM5A represses NOTCH2 and potentially other NOTCH target genes to sustain neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC.
1846	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	72	Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), we confirmed that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated elimination of KDM5A in GLC16 cells increased NOTCH2 and HES1 (a canonical NOTCH target gene) mRNA levels and decreased ASCL1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3C–E).
1847	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	73	In line with these data, treatment of three different SCLC cell lines (GLC16, NCI-H1876, and NCI-H69 cells) with KDM5-C70 increased HES1 mRNA levels in all three cell lines and increased NOTCH2 expression in GLC16 and NCI-H1876 cells (Fig. 3F–H).
1848	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	74	We then performed endogenous KDM5A ChIP sequencing experiments in two different SCLC lines (GLC16 and NCI-H1876) to determine whether KDM5A binds the promoters of NOTCH2 and NOTCH2 target genes.
1849	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	75	We detected binding of KDM5A to the NOTCH2 promoter, canonical NOTCH target genes such as HES1 and HEY1, as well as NOTCH2NL (Supplemental Fig. S3A–D), which is a gene duplication of NOTCH2 that functions to amplify NOTCH2 signaling (Fiddes et al. 2018; Suzuki et al. 2018).
1850	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	76	The binding of KDM5A to NOTCH2 and NOTCH2NL correlated with increased NOTCH2 and NOTCH2NL mRNA expression in the KDM5A knockout cells (Supplemental Fig. S3E).
1851	6942053	BODY16	RESULTS	77	Together, these results demonstrate that KDM5A represses NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes in SCLC through direct binding.
1852	6942053	BODY17	RESULTS	78	We next asked whether NOTCH2 overexpression phenocopies KDM5A inactivation in SCLC cell lines.
1853	6942053	BODY17	RESULTS	79	To test this, we infected GLC16 cells, which express low levels of NOTCH2 (Supplemental Fig. S2A), with a lentivirus that expresses transcriptionally active NOTCH2 (N2-ICD) in the presence of doxycycline (DOX-On N2-ICD-FLAG) or with the corresponding empty vector (DOX-On EV) (Supplemental Fig. S2B).
1854	6942053	BODY17	RESULTS	80	We first confirmed that DOX-induced N2-ICD expression induced the canonical NOTCH targets, HES1 and HEY1 (Supplemental Fig. S2D), demonstrating that the exogenous N2-ICD was functional. As has been reported previously (George et al. 2015), enforced expression of N2-ICD slowed cellular proliferation (Supplemental Fig. S2E).
1855	6942053	BODY17	RESULTS	81	Importantly, N2-ICD also decreased ASCL1 mRNA expression and protein levels (Supplemental Fig. S2B,C), thereby recapitulating the effects of KDM5A inactivation.
1856	6942053	BODY18	RESULTS	82	We next asked whether there were similarities between the transcriptional signatures of SCLC cells that overexpress N2-ICD or lack KDM5A.
1857	6942053	BODY18	RESULTS	83	To answer this, we first performed RNA sequencing in DOX-On N2-ICD cells grown in the presence or absence of DOX and in cells in which KDM5A was or was not inactivated using CRISPR/Cas9.
1858	6942053	BODY18	RESULTS	84	The top 20 target genes induced by N2-ICD (+ DOX compared with −DOX) were comprised of several known NOTCH target genes, including HES and HEY family transcriptional repressors and NRARP, and also some candidate novel NOTCH target genes (Supplemental Fig. S2F).
1859	6942053	BODY18	RESULTS	85	Remarkably, nine of the top 20 genes up-regulated by N2-ICD were also significantly up-regulated upon KDM5A knockdown (Supplemental Fig. S2H).
1860	6942053	BODY19	RESULTS	86	The top 20 target genes down-regulated by N2-ICD included ASCL1 and the neuroendocrine transcription factor INSM1 (Supplemental Fig. S2G), which is regulated by ASCL1 (Borromeo et al. 2016).
1861	6942053	BODY19	RESULTS	87	Both ASCL1 and INSM1 were also significantly down-regulated in KDM5A knockdown cells (Supplemental Fig. S2I).
1862	6942053	BODY19	RESULTS	88	Together, these data show that there is substantial overlap between the transcriptional signatures of KDM5A inactivation and NOTCH2 overexpression that converge on ASCL1 regulation and neuroendocrine differentiation.
1863	6942053	BODY20	RESULTS	89	In the simplest model, KDM5A represses NOTCH2 to sustain neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC.
1864	6942053	BODY20	RESULTS	90	To test this directly, we performed an epistasis experiment by inactivating NOTCH2 and KDM5A, alone or in combination, in GLC16 cells using CRISPR/Cas9.
1865	6942053	BODY20	RESULTS	91	A nontargeting sgRNA was used as a control.
1866	6942053	BODY20	RESULTS	92	Consistent with our previous results, inactivating KDM5A alone dramatically decreased ASCL1 levels (Fig. 3I).
1867	6942053	BODY20	RESULTS	93	Strikingly, ASCL1 levels were completely restored in KDM5A knockdown cells where NOTCH2 was also inactivated (Fig. 3I).
1868	6942053	BODY20	RESULTS	94	Furthermore, a γ-secretase inhibitor that blocks NOTCH activation at the plasma membrane also restored ASCL1 levels in cells in which KDM5A was inactivated using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplemental Fig. S1I).
1869	6942053	BODY20	RESULTS	95	Therefore, KDM5A's ability to sustain ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation is NOTCH2-dependent.
1870	6942053	BODY21	RESULTS	96	Similar to our findings with KDM5A, LSD1, which demethylates monomethylated H3K4 (Shi et al. 2004), was recently shown to be a dependency in SCLC through its ability to repress NOTCH and sustain ASCL1 (Augert et al. 2019).
1871	6942053	BODY21	RESULTS	97	Given that KDM5A and LSD1 both converge on H3K4 methylation (Shi et al. 2004; Christensen et al. 2007; Klose et al. 2007), we hypothesized that combined inhibition of KDM5A and LSD1 would be synergistic.
1872	6942053	BODY21	RESULTS	98	To test this, we treated NCI-H69 and NCI-H1876 cells with varying concentrations of KDM5-C70 alone, the LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001 alone, or both inhibitors.
1873	6942053	BODY21	RESULTS	99	As previously reported, KDM5-C70 selectively increased H3K4 trimethylation, while ORY-1001 did not (Supplemental Fig. S4A).
1874	6942053	BODY21	RESULTS	100	Combining KDM5-C70 and ORY-1001 at low concentrations synergistically suppressed ASCL1 levels (Supplemental Fig. S4B,E) and cellular proliferation (Supplemental Fig. S4C,D,F,G).
1875	6942053	BODY22	RESULTS	101	To accelerate our ability to study the role of Kdm5a in SCLC tumorigenesis in the RPP GEMM of SCLC, we developed a novel SCLC GEMM using CRISPR/Cas9.
1876	6942053	BODY22	RESULTS	102	To do this we made an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses Cre recombinase and Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 sgRNAs (Fig. 4A) and confirmed that it inactivated these three genes when introduced into Cas9-positive mouse embryonic fibroblasts and inactivated a floxed GFP reporter in cellular assays (Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S5A–D).
1877	6942053	BODY24	RESULTS	103	We then introduced this AAV (referred to hereafter as RPP AAV) into the lungs of Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) Cas9 mice by intratracheal (IT) injection and began monitoring the mice by biweekly lung MRIs 8 mo later.
1878	6942053	BODY24	RESULTS	104	The mice began developing tumors about 200 d after IT injection and most were dead within 1 yr (Fig. 4C,E,F).
1879	6942053	BODY24	RESULTS	105	At necropsy, most of these mice had liver metastases and some had kidney/adrenal metastases (Fig. 4D; Supplemental Fig. S5E), both consistent with the behavior of human SCLC and mouse SCLC GEMMs (Kalemkerian et al. 2013; Gazdar et al. 2015).
1880	6942053	BODY24	RESULTS	106	Seven out of eight mice that developed lung tumors had histology consistent with SCLC (the eighth had mixed histology more suggestive of lung adenocarcinoma) and expressed the neuroendocrine markers Ascl1 and Synaptophysin (Fig. 4D; Supplemental Fig. S5E) and, when examined, harbored loss-of-function insertion/deletions at the expected CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites for the Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 sgRNAs (Supplemental Fig. S5F,G).
1881	6942053	BODY24	RESULTS	107	Interestingly, >90% of the CRISPR amplicon sequencing reads for Rb1 and Trp53 within each tumor revealed single base pair, presumably loss-of-function insertions, consistent with strong positive selection of these insertions in founder clones (Supplemental Fig. S5F).
1882	6942053	BODY24	RESULTS	108	Therefore CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to generate SCLC through somatic gene editing of Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 in mice.
1883	6942053	BODY25	RESULTS	109	To study the role of Kdm5a in SCLC tumorigenesis, we next generated adenoviruses that encoded Cre and sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 together with an sgRNA targeting Kdm5a (referred to hereafter as sgKdm5a RPP) or a nontargeting control sgRNA (referred to hereafter as sgControl RPP) (Fig. 5A,B; Supplemental Fig. S6A).
1884	6942053	BODY25	RESULTS	110	We switched from AAV to adenovirus because IT administration of Cre to make SCLC GEMMs has traditionally been accomplished with adenoviruses (Meuwissen et al. 2003) and because we observed, upon treating additional mice, that ∼25% of mice administered the RPP AAV developed pulmonary histiocytic sarcomas.
1885	6942053	BODY27	RESULTS	111	We then introduced either the sgKdm5a RPP or sgControl RPP adenovirus into the lungs of LSL-Cas9 mice and began monitoring the mice by monthly MRI 6 mo later.
1886	6942053	BODY27	RESULTS	112	Tumors developed with a longer latency (Fig. 5D), and grew more slowly (Fig. 5C,E–G; Supplemental Figs. S6B,C), in the sgKdm5A RPP mice compared with the sgControl RPP mice.
1887	6942053	BODY27	RESULTS	113	Moreover, there was a significant decrease in metastasis in sgKdm5a RPP mice compared with sgControl RPP mice (Fig. 5H; Supplemental Fig. S6F).
1888	6942053	BODY27	RESULTS	114	These biological differences were associated with an increase in median overall survival in sgKdm5a RPP mice compared with sgControl RPP mice (Fig. 5I).
1889	6942053	BODY27	RESULTS	115	At necropsy, >90% of tumors formed in both sgKdm5a RPP mice and sgControl RPP mice were SCLC based on histological analysis after staining with hematoxylin and eosin and antibodies against the neuroendocrine markers Ascl1, Synaptophysin, and Chromogranin A (Supplemental Figs. S6D,E, S7A,B).
1890	6942053	BODY27	RESULTS	116	CRISPR amplicon sequencing of tumors for Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 showed that all three genes were completely inactivated in SCLCs formed in both sgKdm5a RPP mice and sgControl RPP mice (Supplemental Fig. S6G).
1891	6942053	BODY27	RESULTS	117	Collectively, this shows that Kdm5a promotes SCLC tumorigenesis and metastasis.
1892	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	118	Given that Kdm5a promotes SCLC tumorigenesis (Fig. 5), we then asked how tumors were able to form in mice that were injected with the sgKdm5a RPP adenovirus.
1893	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	119	One possibility was that these tumors selected for functional Kdm5a (either nonedited Kdm5a or in-frame insertions/deletions of Kdm5a).
1894	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	120	Surprisingly, CRISPR amplicon sequencing of the tumors that formed despite the Kdm5a sgRNA revealed that the sgRNA target site for Kdm5a contained an insertion that would lead to a premature stop codon (Supplemental Fig. S7C,D) at an allelic frequency concordant with insertion/deletions found in Rb1 and Trp53 in 11/11 SCLC tumors examined.
1895	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	121	Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Kdm5a confirmed loss of protein expression of Kdm5a in mice treated with sgKdm5a RPP (Supplemental Fig. S7A,B).
1896	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	122	There were no global changes in trimethylation of H3K4 levels in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Supplemental Fig. S8A,B).
1897	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	123	Lastly, mRNA expression of other Kdm5 family paralogs (Kdm5b, Kdm5c, and Kdm5d) was similar in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Supplemental Fig. S8C).
1898	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	124	Together, the mutational and immunohistochemical analyses of KDM5A demonstrate that Kdm5a was successfully inactivated in the tumors arising in the sgKdm5A RPP mice.
1899	6942053	BODY28	RESULTS	125	Conceivably, these tumors underwent genetic or epigenetic changes that rendered them Kdm5a-independent.
1900	6942053	BODY29	RESULTS	126	Our mouse model allowed us to ask whether Kdm5a also represses Notch2 levels in vivo as it does in cell culture.
1901	6942053	BODY29	RESULTS	127	We first developed and validated IHC assays for Notch2 and Notch1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which we had deleted Notch2 or Notch1 using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplemental Fig. S9A,B).
1902	6942053	BODY29	RESULTS	128	Consistent with our in vitro studies, the percentage of Notch2-positive tumor cells by IHC in sgKdm5a RPP tumors was increased compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6A,B; Supplemental Fig. S9C,D).
1903	6942053	BODY29	RESULTS	129	To corroborate these findings, we also isolated cell lines from sgKdm5a RPP and sgControl RPP tumors using two independent methods (see Materials and Methods) (Liu et al. 2017).
1904	6942053	BODY29	RESULTS	130	Cell lines derived from sgKDM5a RPP tumors had increased levels of Notch2 and decreased levels of the neuroendocrine markers Ascl1 and Synaptophysin compared with the cell lines derived from sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6D; Supplemental Fig. S10A).
1905	6942053	BODY29	RESULTS	131	Interestingly, cells lines generated from the sgKdm5a RPP tumors were more adherent than cell lines generated from the sgControl RPP tumors (Supplemental Fig. S10B,C), a phenotype that has been correlated with a non-neuroendocrine phenotype (Calbo et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2017).
1906	6942053	BODY31	RESULTS	132	To better understand the global transcriptional changes caused by Kdm5a inactivation in SCLC tumors, we performed RNA sequencing and GSEA comparing sgKdm5a RPP tumors and sgControl RPP tumors.
1907	6942053	BODY31	RESULTS	133	Consistent with our in vitro data (Fig. 3) and in vivo data (Fig. 6A,B), GSEA showed significantly increased NOTCH signaling in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6C).
1908	6942053	BODY31	RESULTS	134	Several gene sets associated with differentiation/cell state changes were also up-regulated in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with control tumors, including an epithelial mesenchymal transition gene set (Fig. 6C).
1909	6942053	BODY31	RESULTS	135	Furthermore, K-Ras signaling was also up-regulated in sgKdm5a RPP tumors (Fig. 6C), which might circumvent the growth inhibitory effects of Kdm5a loss and, like Kdm5a loss, decreases neuroendocrine markers in SCLC cell lines (Calbo et al. 2011).
1910	6942053	BODY32	RESULTS	136	Interestingly, our RNA sequencing data showed that Dlk1, a Notch inhibitory ligand that is highly expressed in many human SCLC tumors (George et al. 2015), was the fourth most significantly up-regulated gene in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6E).
1911	6942053	BODY32	RESULTS	137	We validated our RNA sequencing results using RT-qPCR for Nell1 (the most up-regulated gene in sgKdm5a RPP tumors) and Dlk1 in the sgKdm5a RPP and sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6F,G).
1912	6942053	BODY32	RESULTS	138	Notch signaling suppresses SCLC and, as shown here, is up-regulated in cells lacking Kdm5a.
1913	6942053	BODY32	RESULTS	139	Up-regulation of Dlk1 might serve to mitigate the tumor-suppressive effect of Notch (George et al. 2015) pursuant to Kdm5a loss.
1914	6942053	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	140	We show that the H3K4 demethylase KDM5A represses NOTCH2 and thereby sustains ASCL1 expression in SCLC.
1915	6942053	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	141	ASCL1 transcriptionally activates genes that promote neuroendocrine differentiation and SCLC tumorigenesis, and genetic loss of ASCL1 inhibits SCLC tumorigenesis in a genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC (Borromeo et al. 2016).
1916	6942053	BODY33	CONCLUSIONS	142	Consistent with these observations, we observed that loss of KDM5A retards the development and growth of mouse SCLCs and that KDM5A-defective mouse SCLCs exhibit increased NOTCH2, increased NOTCH signaling, decreased ASCL1, and decreased neuroendocrine differentiation relative to their KDM5A-proficient counterparts.
1917	6942053	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	143	NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 are bona fide SCLCs tumor suppressor genes, but many SCLCs that lack NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 mutations nonetheless have impaired NOTCH activity (George et al. 2015).
1918	6942053	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	144	Our findings suggest that RB1 loss and deregulation of KDM5A suffices to at least partially inhibit NOTCH activity.
1919	6942053	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	145	The subsequent inactivation of NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 would conceivably attenuate NOTCH signaling even further.
1920	6942053	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	146	We note that NOTCH1 mutations are more common than NOTCH2 mutations in SCLC (George et al. 2015).
1921	6942053	BODY34	CONCLUSIONS	147	RB1 loss and deregulation of KDM5A partially down-regulates NOTCH2 and spares NOTCH1, which would increase the selection pressure to inactivate NOTCH1.
1922	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	148	H3K4 methylation has been linked to NOTCH signaling previously (Moshkin et al. 2009; Liefke et al. 2010; Di Stefano et al. 2011).
1923	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	149	H3K4 trimethylation near transcription start sites typically enhances transcription, while monomethylated H3K4 often marks transcriptional enhancers (Beshiri et al. 2012; Whyte et al. 2012).
1924	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	150	KDM5 family members and KDM1A (LSD1) demethylate methylated H3K4, with the former uniquely capable of demethylating trimethylated H3K4 (Shi et al. 2004; Christensen et al. 2007; Klose et al. 2007).
1925	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	151	In model organisms, KDM5A and LSD1 cooperate to directly repress NOTCH target genes through local erasure of H3K4 methylation marks (Di Stefano et al. 2011).
1926	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	152	KDM5A can be recruited to DNA via histone chaperone proteins or via RBP-J, which is a core component of the NOTCH DNA-binding transcriptional complex (Moshkin et al. 2009; Liefke et al. 2010).
1927	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	153	LSD1 forms a complex with SIRT1 that also represses NOTCH target gene expression (Mulligan et al. 2011).
1928	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	154	Our findings suggest that KDM5A also represses NOTCH2 itself.
1929	6942053	BODY35	CONCLUSIONS	155	Importantly, we showed that KDM5A and NOTCH2 are epistatic to one another with respect to control of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine differentiation.
1930	6942053	BODY36	CONCLUSIONS	156	Retinoblastomas and SCLCs are, numerically, the most common tumors linked to germline and somatic RB1 mutations, respectively.
1931	6942053	BODY36	CONCLUSIONS	157	These tumors, like the pituitary and thyroid tumors that develop in Rb1+/− mice, express neuroendocrine markers.
1932	6942053	BODY36	CONCLUSIONS	158	This intimate relationship between RB1 inactivation and neuroendocrine tumors suggests that neuroendocrine cells are especially permissive for transformation after RB1 loss, that RB1 loss causes cells to maintain or adopt neuroendocrine features (Park et al. 2018), or perhaps both.
1933	6942053	BODY36	CONCLUSIONS	159	In this regard, RB1 loss has been linked to acquired drug resistance and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of epithelial cancers (Tan et al. 2014; Niederst et al. 2015; Chang 2017; Ku et al. 2017; Mu et al. 2017), supporting that RB1 loss causes expression of neuroendocrine markers.
1934	6942053	BODY36	CONCLUSIONS	160	Our findings suggest that RB1 loss, and subsequent deregulation of the pRB-binding protein KDM5A, represses NOTCH signaling, increases ASCL1 levels, and thereby increases neuroendocrine differentiation.
1935	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	161	ASCL1 appears to be a lineage addiction oncogene in SCLC, but the ASCL1 protein would classically be viewed as undruggable.
1936	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	162	However, targeting mechanisms that indirectly promote ASCL1 activity, such as inhibiting proteins that normally function to increase ASCL1 mRNA expression, could indirectly inhibit ASCL1.
1937	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	163	Using both genetic and pharmacological tools, we showed that inhibiting KDM5A decreases ASCL1 expression in SCLC cell lines, suggesting that KDM5A inhibition could be used as a therapeutic strategy to target ASCL1.
1938	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	164	Notably, Kdm5a is a nonessential gene in mice and Kdm5a inactivation in mice decreases Rb1−/− neuroendocrine tumors in both prevention and treatment models (Lin et al. 2011; McBrayer et al. 2018).
1939	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	165	A caveat with our study is that the pharmacological inhibitor we used, KDM5-C70, is selective for KDM5 demethylases, but inhibits all four KDM5 family members at nearly equivalent IC50 values (Johansson et al. 2016).
1940	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	166	It is also notable that the antitumor effects that we observed upon genetically ablating Kdm5a in our mouse model, though reproducible, were relatively modest.
1941	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	167	We suspect that this reflects the fact that Kdm5a was inactivated at or near the time of initiation, coupled with strong selective pressure for escape mechanisms when an oncogene is inactivated.
1942	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	168	Indeed, we observed similar effect sizes when we eliminated the SCLC oncoprotein Ascl1 instead of Kdm5a in our mouse model (MG Oser and WG Kaelin, unpubl.).
1943	6942053	BODY37	CONCLUSIONS	169	We imagine that the effects of inactivating Kdm5a might have been greater had we acutely inactivated it in established tumors.
1944	6942053	BODY38	CONCLUSIONS	170	Our preclinical data suggests that combining a KDM5 inhibitor with an LSD1 inhibitor would synergistically suppress ASCL1, which could result in increased efficacy compared with treatment with a KDM5 inhibitor or LSD1 inhibitor alone.
1945	6942053	BODY38	CONCLUSIONS	171	Notably, SCLCs are selectively sensitive to an LSD1 inhibitor compared with other adult solid tumors (Mohammad et al. 2015).
1946	6942053	BODY38	CONCLUSIONS	172	A recent study demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 had striking efficacy in some patient-derived SCLC xenograft models (Augert et al. 2019), which was associated with activation of NOTCH signaling and repression of ASCL1.
1947	6942053	BODY38	CONCLUSIONS	173	Our findings provide a further rationale for developing drugs that specifically inhibit KDM5A and for testing them in preclinical SCLC models alone or in combination with LSD1 inhibitors.
1948	6942053	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	174	We developed a new SCLC GEMM using CRISPR/Cas9 to simultaneously inactivate Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 in the lung.
1949	6942053	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	175	We also showed that this method can be used to rapidly ask whether inactivating a fourth gene (in our case, Kdm5a) can alter the natural history of SCLC.
1950	6942053	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	176	Therefore, this model can be used to interrogate candidate oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, or therapeutic targets without the need for complex and time-consuming breeding strategies.
1951	6942053	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	177	To our knowledge, this is the first SCLC GEMM developed on a pure congenic background, which allows cell lines established from this model to be used for syngeneic transplant studies.
1952	6942053	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	178	Our model is well suited to study response and resistance of SCLC to immunotherapies, which is timely, since the PD-L1 checkpoint blockade antibody Atezolizomab has recently been shown to improve survival when given with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for SCLC patients (Horn et al. 2018).
1953	6942053	BODY39	CONCLUSIONS	179	Furthermore, cell lines derived from our SCLC GEMM stably express Cas9 and therefore could be used directly to perform CRISPR/Cas9 screens to nominate potential SCLC oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, or genes that modulate response or resistance to targeted therapy or immunotherapy.

1971	6942053	BODY41	METHODS	197	The sense and antisense oligonucleotides were mixed at equimolar ratios (0.25 nanomoles of each sense and antisense oligonucleotide) and annealed by heating to 100°C in annealing buffer (1X annealing buffer 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) followed by slow cooling to 30°C over 3 h.

2224	9619308	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	DNA methylation is a key regulator of gene expression and a clinical therapeutic predictor.
2225	9619308	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	We examined global DNA methylation beyond the generally used promoter areas in human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and find that gene body methylation is a robust positive predictor of gene expression.
2226	9619308	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	Combining promoter and gene body methylation better predicts gene expression than promoter methylation alone including genes involved in the neuroendocrine classification of SCLC and the expression of therapeutically relevant genes including MGMT, SLFN11, and DLL3.
2227	9619308	ABS0	ABSTRACT	4	Importantly, for super-enhancer (SE) covered genes such as NEUROD1 or MYC, using H3K27ac and NEUROD1, ASCL1, and POU2F3 ChIP-seq data, we show that genic methylation is inversely proportional to expression, thus providing a new approach to identify potential SE regulated genes involved in SCLC pathogenesis.
2228	9619308	ABS0	ABSTRACT	5	To advance SCLC transitional research, these data are integrated into our web portal (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/) for open and easy access to basic and clinical investigators.

2241	9619308	ABS6	ABSTRACT	18	Epigenetics; Cancer systems biology; Cancer.
2242	9619308	BODY0	BACKGROUND	19	Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) account for approximately 13% of all lung cancers (Govindan et al., 2006; Poirier et al., 2020), and are highly metastatic and rapidly chemoresistant (Gazdar et al., 2017; Sabari et al., 2017).
2243	9619308	BODY0	BACKGROUND	20	Their genetic landscape is different from other lung cancers, with few activating driver mutations in oncogenes, near-universal loss of function-mutational prevalence in TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressor genes, and overexpression of cellular proliferation and replication pathways (Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2244	9619308	BODY0	BACKGROUND	21	Many SCLCs also have increased copy-number changes in members of the MYC oncogene family, and/or disruptive mutations in chromatin remodeler and epigenetic genes such as histone lysine methyltransferases (KMT2D and KMT2C), and histone acetyltransferases (EP300, CREBBP) (George et al., 2015).
2245	9619308	BODY1	BACKGROUND	22	SCLC tumors and patient-derived cell lines and xenografts (PDXs) have recently been classified into four main subtypes based on the expression of 4 lineage-defining transcription factors (LTFs): NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3, and YAP1 (briefly referred to as “NAPY”) (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2246	9619308	BODY1	BACKGROUND	23	Further studies differentiate SCLC into ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 subtypes, and the inflammatory subtype, which benefits from combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy (Gay et al., 2021).
2247	9619308	BODY1	BACKGROUND	24	The NEUROD1 and ASCL1 subtypes have a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype, with elevated expression of NE markers including synaptophysin and chromogranin A.
2248	9619308	BODY1	BACKGROUND	25	The POU2F3 and YAP1 subtypes are non-NE, with elevated NOTCH pathway expression and low expression of NE markers (Pozo et al., 2021; Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2249	9619308	BODY1	BACKGROUND	26	Binding of the LTFs to many distinct sites in the genome has been proposed to act as enhancers and regulate different gene expression pathways that characterize each of the subtypes of SCLCs (Borromeo et al., 2016; Chakraborty et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021; Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2250	9619308	BODY2	BACKGROUND	27	The subtype classification of SCLC is not routinely implemented in clinical practice owing to limited access to well-preserved tumor tissues to perform immunohistochemistry analyses with many diagnostic biopsies coming from needle aspirations (Qu et al., 2022).
2251	9619308	BODY2	BACKGROUND	28	RNA-seq analyses are also not routinely utilized to classify SCLCs based on the differential expression of the LTFs.
2252	9619308	BODY2	BACKGROUND	29	Because of the challenges of RNA analyses and of the greater stability of DNA over RNA, DNA analyses are being effectively tested to classify subtypes of cancers, such as sarcomas (Koelsche et al., 2021).
2253	9619308	BODY2	BACKGROUND	30	Taking advantage of the well-documented genomic databases of SCLC cell lines (Gay et al., 2021; George et al., 2015; Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020), we asked whether DNA methylation analyses based on the clinically used MethylationEPIC array could provide novel insights in the genetic regulatory pathways of SCLCs and be used as a classifier and therapeutic guide for SCLCs.
2254	9619308	BODY3	BACKGROUND	31	DNA methylation is used clinically to correlate survival (Gevaert et al., 2015; Hao et al., 2017), as well as drug response (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Butler et al., 2020; Krushkal et al., 2020; Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2020).
2255	9619308	BODY3	BACKGROUND	32	To that effect, O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG)-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is an established prognostic biomarker in glioblastomas treated with temozolomide (Butler et al., 2020), while Schlafen (SLFN11) expression inactivation through promoter methylation leads to resistance to PARP inhibitors and DNA damaging agents including etoposide, cisplatin, topotecan and lurbinectedin that are used as a standard of care for SCLCs (Kundu et al., 2021; Murai et al., 2016, 2019; Nogales et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2018).
2256	9619308	BODY3	BACKGROUND	33	Although the DNA methylation of promoters is commonly used to predict the lack of gene expression (Butler et al., 2020; Esteller, 2021), in many cases it can give an incomplete picture when the promoters of non-expressed genes are not hypermethylated (Butler et al., 2020; Reinhold et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018).
2257	9619308	BODY3	BACKGROUND	34	Although many methylation probes in the 450k and 850k array platforms, widely used for detecting the methylation of specific gene regions, are outside of promoters, there have been limited analyses and use on their quantitative relationship with gene expression and on their potential translational value to predict gene expression (Lister et al., 2009; Spainhour et al., 2019; Su et al., 2018).
2258	9619308	BODY3	BACKGROUND	35	Yet, gene body methylation has been shown to reflect gene activity (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Yang et al., 2014), suppress alternative transcript isoforms by blocking promoters, and to regulate splicing (Huang et al., 2021; Lev Maor et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018; Neri et al., 2017; Teissandier and Bourc'his, 2017; Yang et al., 2014).
2259	9619308	BODY4	BACKGROUND	36	Studies have begun to explore the epigenetics of SCLCs by mapping the binding sites of the LTFs (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018), the enhancers based on histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (Pozo et al., 2021), and promoter DNA methylation (Krushkal et al., 2020; Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2260	9619308	BODY4	BACKGROUND	37	To expand our understanding of how gene expression is regulated in SCLC and determine the potential translational value of the MethylationEPIC 850k array, we took advantage of the SCLC cell line databases (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/) and integrated whole genome DNA methylation (Krushkal et al., 2020; Tlemsani et al., 2020), enhancer H3K27ac ChIP-seq (Huang et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021) and ChIP-seq for the three main LTFs driving SCLC pathogenesis (ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3) (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018).
2261	9619308	BODY4	BACKGROUND	38	We developed algorithms to automatically quantify the levels of promoter and gene body methylation, as well as copy number and promoter acetylation for each gene.
2262	9619308	BODY4	BACKGROUND	39	And for each epigenetic marker (DNA methylation, H3K27Ac, and ChIP-seq for ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3), we analyzed their genomic distribution and demonstrate how they mutually predict gene expression.
2263	9619308	BODY4	BACKGROUND	40	The data are integrated in a public web-based genomic platform in our CellMinerCDB ecosystem (Luna et al., 2021), enabling individual researchers and clinicians to explore genomic and drug response correlations across the NCI, UT Southwestern, Broad-MIT (CCLE), and Welcome-Sanger databases (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/).
2264	9619308	BODY5	RESULTS	41	High-resolution DNA methylation (EPIC 850K array) was obtained for 68 different SCLC patient-derived cell lines (Krushkal et al., 2020; Tlemsani et al., 2020), H3K27ac data for 18 SCLC lines (Huang et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021) and ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 ChIP-seq for 6 SCLC lines (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018).
2265	9619308	BODY5	RESULTS	42	We analyzed each dataset and studied their predictive value as classifiers of SCLCs and predictors of gene expression.
2266	9619308	BODY5	RESULTS	43	The data included in the present study are summarized in Figure 1A and Table S1; they are publicly accessible in the updated version (v.1.1) of SCLC_Cellminer (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/).
2267	9619308	BODY5	RESULTS	44	Figure 1Overview of cell lines utilized in the study(A) Data types available for each cell line (gene expression, DNA methylation, and H3K37ac) and their neuroendocrine status and NAPY classification.

2271	9619308	BODY5	RESULTS	48	YAP1 cell lines cluster with NSCLC cell lines.

(F) Methylation probes at the MGMT promoter in 5 cell lines (2 with high and 3 with low MGMT expression).
2273	9619308	BODY13	RESULTS	50	The EPICmethylation 850K array probes are not only in promoters (40.6%), but also in genic areas (35.2%) and intergenic regions (24.2%) (Figure 1B).
2274	9619308	BODY13	RESULTS	51	Compared to the 450K array, the higher resolution of the EPIC 850K methylation array has more than double the coverage in genic areas (Figure S1A).
2275	9619308	BODY13	RESULTS	52	The comparison of the methylation levels of different genomic regions across all SCLC lines shows that DNA methylation probes overall tend to be hypermethylated, with approximately 58.4% (40.3–70%) of probes with beta value > 0.5 (Figure 1C, Table S2).
2276	9619308	BODY13	RESULTS	53	This may be related to the fact that cell lines from SCLC express significantly higher levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A (and DNMT3B) compared to other cancers (Figure S1B).
2277	9619308	BODY13	RESULTS	54	Yet, as expected, CpG islands and promoters tend to be hypomethylated (median 22.9 and 48.4%, respectively) compared to gene body and intergenic regions (median 78%) (Figures 1C and S1C; Table S2).
2278	9619308	BODY14	RESULTS	55	DNA methylation has been previously used to cluster cell lines based on the tissue of origin (Ghandi et al., 2019).
2279	9619308	BODY14	RESULTS	56	Thus, we assessed whether the genome-wide EPICmethylation array would differentiate SCLC subtypes.
2280	9619308	BODY14	RESULTS	57	Although the non-neuroendocrine YAP1 and NSCLC cell lines showed distinct clustering, the SCLC cell lines showed limited clustering based on their NE status using UMAP clustering of all probes (Figure 1D, Table S3).
2281	9619308	BODY14	RESULTS	58	As expected, some NEUROD1 cell lines with dual ASCL1-NEUROD1 expression (Figures S1D and S1E, Table S3) clustered with the ASCL1 subgroup (Figure S1D, green arrowheads) (Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2282	9619308	BODY14	RESULTS	59	UMAP clustering using CpG, promoter, gene body, and intergenic probes yielded similar results.
2283	9619308	BODY14	RESULTS	60	In case of gene body and promoter probes the NEUROD1 cell lines that did not express ASCL1 had a better separation from the ASCL1 cluster (Figure S1E).
2284	9619308	BODY14	RESULTS	61	Overall, we conclude that the methylation array has limited value in clustering cells into subtypes.
2285	9619308	BODY15	RESULTS	62	Studies comparing gene expression and DNA methylation classically focus on the methylation of promoters, where hypermethylation is associated with low gene expression (Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2020; Reinhold et al., 2017).
2286	9619308	BODY15	RESULTS	63	Yet, for many genes and across cell lines, we observed that low gene expression was observed despite low promoter methylation.
2287	9619308	BODY15	RESULTS	64	This is illustrated in Figures S1F and S1G for the therapeutic response predictor Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) (Murai et al., 2019) and the mesenchymal Vimentin (VIM) genes.
2288	9619308	BODY15	RESULTS	65	To extend this finding genome-wide, we selected the genes with highest SD bimodal gene expression distribution (Figure S1H), finding that more than 50% of the low-expressing cell lines showed hypomethylated promoters.
2289	9619308	BODY16	RESULTS	66	Among those genes where lack of expression fails to highly correlate with promoter hypermethylation is the methylguanine methyl transferase gene (MGMT), which is routinely analyzed in the context of temozolomide treatments (Butler et al., 2020; Farago et al., 2019; Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2020).
2290	9619308	BODY16	RESULTS	67	MGMT showed a relatively low negative correlation (although significant) between promoter methylation and gene expression (Figures 1E and S1H).
2291	9619308	BODY16	RESULTS	68	Detailed examination of the methylation probes in the promoter area of MGMT revealed that highly expressing cell lines showed consistent CpG hypomethylation, while cell lines with low expression displayed variable promoter methylation (Figure 1F).
2292	9619308	BODY16	RESULTS	69	In addition, comparing the methylation (probe) distribution across the MGMT locus showed hypermethylation of genic probes in the highly expressing cells (Figure S1I).
2293	9619308	BODY16	RESULTS	70	These observations indicate that promoter hypomethylation does not accurately predict gene expression and thus must be controlled by additional epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.
2294	9619308	BODY17	RESULTS	71	To explore the relationship between DNA methylation in gene bodies and gene expression (Teissandier and Bourc'his, 2017), we focused on the distribution of DNA methylation by comparing methylation in promoter (−2.5kb–2.5kb area around transcription start sites), gene body (genic area excluding promoter regions) and upstream (5kb window upstream of promoter regions) and downstream (5kb window downstream of transcription end sites) regions of genes.
2295	9619308	BODY17	RESULTS	72	Stratifying a large number of genes based on their expression showed a marked difference in overall DNA methylation patterns (Figure 2A).
2296	9619308	BODY17	RESULTS	73	As expected, highly expressed genes showed hypomethylation centered in promoters (upper tracings in Figure 2A), while promoter hypermethylation was observed in lowly expressed genes (lower tracing in Figure 2A).
2297	9619308	BODY17	RESULTS	74	Notably, the gene body of highly expressed genes was consistently hypermethylated (top tracings), while gene bodies were significantly less methylated and more variable in genes with low or no expression (bottom tracings in Figure 2A).
2298	9619308	BODY17	RESULTS	75	These methylation profiles were similar in all cell lines in the SCLC database, and the methylation types were reproducible using reduced bisulfite sequencing data obtained from the CCLE (Ghandi et al., 2019) (Figures S2A–S2C).
2299	9619308	BODY17	RESULTS	76	The bisulfite data are also available in CellMinerCDB (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb) (Luna et al., 2021).

2304	9619308	BODY17	RESULTS	81	The heatmaps on the left show promoter and gene body methylation for highly expressed genes (TOP2A and B2M) and non-expressed genes (DIRC1 and CRISP3).

2308	9619308	BODY25	RESULTS	85	As gene body methylation was consistently associated with expression for many genes, we created a gene-level summarization algorithm of gene body methylation taking into account all probes instead of using a single-probe approach (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Krushkal et al., 2020), and which can be used to assess independently promoter and gene body methylation.
2309	9619308	BODY25	RESULTS	86	We included gene body probes outside of promoters, excluding CpG island overlapping probes, which tend to be hypomethylated (see Figure 1).
2310	9619308	BODY25	RESULTS	87	In cases where a gene had multiple transcripts, we selected the transcript with the most positive correlation between gene body methylation level and gene expression.
2311	9619308	BODY25	RESULTS	88	Only a very small number of very short genes such as ASCL1 could not be analyzed for gene body methylation because of insufficient probe coverage.
2312	9619308	BODY25	RESULTS	89	Based on this approach, we were able to provide scores for both gene body and promoter methylation and integrated these features in SCLC-CellMinerCDB (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/sclccellminercdb).
2313	9619308	BODY26	RESULTS	90	Using the genome-wide methylome data from all 66 SCLC cell lines (see Figure 1A), we compared promoter and gene body methylation as a function of gene expression.
2314	9619308	BODY26	RESULTS	91	The gene promoter methylation values and gene expression data were obtained from the SCLC-CellMinerCDB website (Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2315	9619308	BODY26	RESULTS	92	Non-expressed genes across all SCLC cell lines (Figure 2B, left) clustered in 3 distinct groups: genes methylated both on the promoter and gene body (upper right quadrant), genes with no methylation at all (bottom left), and genes with both promoter hypomethylation and gene body methylation (upper left).
2316	9619308	BODY26	RESULTS	93	By contrast, highly expressed genes (Figure 2B, right) were found to be hypomethylated on their promoters and consistently hypermethylated in their gene bodies.
2317	9619308	BODY26	RESULTS	94	These analyses demonstrate that analyzing promoter methylation (bmt) is insufficient to accurately predict gene expression and that adding gene body methylation improves the gene expression correlation.
2318	9619308	BODY27	RESULTS	95	Figure 2C illustrates the relationship of gene expression and DNA methylation for specific genes exhibiting different expression ranges.
2319	9619308	BODY27	RESULTS	96	Topoisomerase II-alpha (TOP2A) or beta-2-macroglobuin (B2M), which are housekeeping genes highly expressed across cell lines show the lack of promoter methylation and high gene body methylation, as expected (Figure 2C, upper left).
2320	9619308	BODY27	RESULTS	97	By contrast, genes that are generally not expressed, such as DIRC1 and CRISP3 show concomitant hyper- or hypomethylation of both promoters and gene bodies (Figure 2C, bottom left).
2321	9619308	BODY27	RESULTS	98	Additional examples demonstrating this concomitant hyper- and hypomethylation for low-expression genes are shown in Figure S2D for the GLT8D2, EYS and GJA8 genes.
2322	9619308	BODY27	RESULTS	99	We also observed that the expression of genes with high range of expression such as MGMT, SLFN11, and NOTCH1 shows highest correlation with gene body methylation (Figure 2C, right) rather than promoter hypomethylation.
2323	9619308	BODY27	RESULTS	100	Together these results stress the relevance of gene body methylation as a predictor of gene expression.
2324	9619308	BODY28	RESULTS	101	Analyzing YAP1, a driver gene for a subset of non-NE SCLCs (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020) reveals that YAP1-expressing cell lines have no hypomethylated promoter with a hypermethylated gene body (“Active” group) (Figures 2C and 2D).
2325	9619308	BODY28	RESULTS	102	Many YAP1 non-expressing cell lines have either hypermethylation (“Hyper” group) or hypomethylation (“Hypo” group) of the YAP1 promoter and gene body.
2326	9619308	BODY28	RESULTS	103	There are some cell lines that do not express YAP1 with a hypermethylated promoter and hypomethylated gene body (“Divergent” group).
2327	9619308	BODY28	RESULTS	104	Thus, overall, the methylation categories based on both promoter and gene body methylation reveal that the “active” (low promoter methylation with high gene body methylation) group predicts the expression of YAP1 (Figure 2E).
2328	9619308	BODY29	RESULTS	105	Additional examples where gene body methylation predicts gene expression better than promoter methylation are provided in Figure 2F for MGMT, SLFN11 and the cell surface glycoprotein and cancer biomarker CEACAM5, which is selectively expressed in neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines (Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2329	9619308	BODY29	RESULTS	106	Thus, scoring gene body methylation in addition to promoter methylation can be particularly helpful to predict gene expression for genes with a wide range of expression, and this feature has been implemented in our new SCLC-CellMinerCDB release (v.1.1) along with other features that are listed in Table S4 (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/).
2330	9619308	BODY30	RESULTS	107	Because histone post-translational modifications are key epigenetic regulators, we integrated into our methylome analysis the recently available H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (Pozo et al., 2021) for eighteen of the SCLC cell lines (see Figure 1A).
2331	9619308	BODY30	RESULTS	108	Our analysis identified ∼239,000 enhancers defined by H3K27ac peaks, which are mainly localized in intergenic and gene body areas, with a relatively small fraction in promoters (Figure 3A).

2338	9619308	BODY30	RESULTS	115	Hypomethylation can be seen at the binding sites, with a valley of H3K27ac.
2339	9619308	BODY38	RESULTS	116	Phylogenic analysis of the H3K27ac data for the enhancers with highest range of signal intensity (to reduce background noise) across cell lines showed that the cell lines formed three main clusters, differentiating the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 subtypes, and confirming the distinct enhancer signatures of the SCLC subtypes, in agreement with the recently published super-enhancer analysis (Pozo et al., 2021).
2340	9619308	BODY38	RESULTS	117	Cluster heatmap representation of the H3K27ac signals based on the 4 subtypes ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1 produced 4 main clusters (Figure 3C; Table S5).
2341	9619308	BODY38	RESULTS	118	HOMER sequence motif analysis revealed that clusters 1, 2 & 3 are significantly enriched for the DNA sequence motifs of ASCL1, POU2F3, and NEUROD1 (Figure 3C, right).
2342	9619308	BODY38	RESULTS	119	The fourth enhancer cluster (cluster 4) mainly differentiates the NE and non-NE subtypes, with enrichment in promoter areas (Figure S3A).
2343	9619308	BODY38	RESULTS	120	Differential GO analysis showed enrichment in neuronal pathways for the ASCL1 and NEUROD1-specific enhancers, and enrichment of the extracellular matrix organization and YAP1-TAZ pathways for the non-NE clusters (Figure S3B).
2344	9619308	BODY39	RESULTS	121	UMAP clustering of the enhancers with highest range of signal intensity across cell lines differentiated 2 main groups of enhancers: enhancers bound in promoter sites vs. non-promoter sites (Figure S3C, left, red points).
2345	9619308	BODY39	RESULTS	122	Notably, enhancers matching the SCLC-LTF subtypes (ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3) were found enriched with non-promoter sites (Figure S3C, right).
2346	9619308	BODY39	RESULTS	123	These data are consistent with the presence of multiple sites of specific enhancers and super-enhancer (SE) for each of the subtypes of SCLC cell lines located outside of promoters (Pozo et al., 2021).
2347	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	124	To analyze the relationship between H3K27 acetylation (enhancers and SEs) and the SCLC-LTFs, we analyzed the ChIP-seq data obtained for ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 in the 6 cell lines with overlapping data (see Figure 1A) (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018).
2348	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	125	Like the H3K27ac histone marks, most sites were distributed in intergenic regions or within gene bodies.
2349	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	126	Yet, the binding sites of ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 showed minor overlap (Figure 3D), which is consistent with the sequence specificity and specific distribution of each SCLC-LTF (Borromeo et al., 2016).
2350	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	127	Consistent with published results (Borromeo et al., 2016), the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 binding sites were found mainly localized outside of promoters (Figure 3A).
2351	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	128	Alignment of the genomic tracings for three representative cell lines corresponding to each subtype (NCI-H889 for ASCL1, H82 for NEUROD1 and H1048 for POU2F3) shows that the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 binding sites do not overlap with each other (Figure 3E).
2352	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	129	Furthermore, alignment with the H3K27ac data shows that the differential distribution of the LTF sites is concordant with enhancer signals in each of these regions (Figure 3E).
2353	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	130	For instance, regions bound by ASCL1 have matching active enhancers in NCI-H889 cells, but not in the other cell lines.
2354	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	131	Similar distribution could be seen in the case of the NEUROD1 sites in NCI-H82 cells and of the POU2F3 sites in NCI-H1048 cells (Figure 3E).
2355	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	132	Also, for each SCLC-LTF, the sites of LTF binding are within a short central segment with reduced H3K27ac signal corresponding to the LTF binding peaks (Figures 3E and 3F).
2356	9619308	BODY40	RESULTS	133	The few overlapping binding sites across the three SCLC-LTFs show that the shared enhancers had the same lack of H3K27ac signal at the SCLC-LTF binding peaks (Figure S3E).
2357	9619308	BODY41	RESULTS	134	To establish the potential relationship between LTF-specific enhancers and DNA methylation, we overlaid the DNA methylation tracings with each of the SCLC-LTF enhancer regions.
2358	9619308	BODY41	RESULTS	135	This showed that the summits of the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 ChIP-seq peaks are characterized by a dip in DNA methylation, consistent with the possibility that the SCLC-LTFs only bind unmethylated DNA sites outside of promoters and are flanked by hyperacetylated H3K27 regions (Figure 3F).
2359	9619308	BODY42	RESULTS	136	For the enhancers localized in gene promoters (∼40,000 sites corresponding to ∼30% of the total H3K27ac signals; see Figure 3A), enhancer signals (H3K27ac) were found positively correlated with gene expression and inversely correlated with DNA methylation (Figure 4A).
2360	9619308	BODY42	RESULTS	137	Highly expressed genes displayed the highest levels of H3K27ac signal, and genes with intermediate expression across cell lines displayed intermediate H3K27ac signal (Figure 4A).
2361	9619308	BODY42	RESULTS	138	Figure 4B (right panels) shows representative genomic tracings and quantitative analyses performed automatically on the CellMinerCDB web portal (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/) for MGMT and SLFN11.
2362	9619308	BODY42	RESULTS	139	As expected, promoter acetylation is generally highly correlated with gene expression for effector genes.

(F) Correlation summary of gene expression and H3K27ac, DNA promoter and gene body methylation and copy-number data using genes with the most variable expression.
2369	9619308	BODY49	RESULTS	146	Promoter enhancer signals for the SCLC-LTF genes were also closely correlated with the subtypes of SCLCs (Figure 4C), and selected SCLC-relevant genes including the MYC genes (MYC, MYCL, and MYCN), the NE SCLC markers (SYP, INSM1, and CHGA) and the NOTCH genes (NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH3) all displayed tight correlation between promoter enhancer H3K27ac signals and gene expression (Figure S4A).
2370	9619308	BODY50	RESULTS	147	Additionally, the super enhancer (SE) signals for ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 (Pozo et al., 2021) revealed overlap for each set of SE in the corresponding subtypes, correlating with the expression levels of each of the LTFs (Figure S4B).
2371	9619308	BODY50	RESULTS	148	Exploring further the relationship between enhancers determined by H3K27ac and DNA methylation, we observed that DNA methylation probes overlapping enhancers tend to be hypomethylated compared to non-enhancer sites regardless of their localization (promoters, gene bodies, and intergenic regions as well) (Figure S4C).
2372	9619308	BODY50	RESULTS	149	We also observed that in the case of strong enhancers (and SEs) covering entire genes, the gene body methylation probes tended to be hypomethylated.
2373	9619308	BODY50	RESULTS	150	This can be seen in the case of NEUROD1 and NKX2-1, where cell lines with high genic H3K27ac signal show low gene body methylation, resulting in a negative correlation between gene expression and gene body methylation (Figures 4D and 4E).
2374	9619308	BODY50	RESULTS	151	These observations demonstrate that gene body methylation, which for most expressed genes is closely associated with transcription, is low in genes that are covered by enhancers and/or super enhancers like NEUROD1.
2375	9619308	BODY51	RESULTS	152	To facilitate further analyses, we generated a gene-level H3K27ac summarization algorithm, which is implemented in SclcCellMinerCDB version 1.1 (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb).
2376	9619308	BODY51	RESULTS	153	This feature was used to generate the plots and statistical analyses shown in the right panels of Figures 4B, 4D, and 4E.
2377	9619308	BODY51	RESULTS	154	We also used this algorithm to compare promoter H3K27ac, promoter, and gene body methylation and copy number (CNV) with gene expression.
2378	9619308	BODY51	RESULTS	155	Promoter enhancer signal shows the strongest correlation with gene expression (Figure 4F).
2379	9619308	BODY51	RESULTS	156	Gene body methylation shows better predictive power over promoter methylation in the case of genes with high range of expression; yet promoter methylation has slightly better overall predictive power when including all genes (Figure S4D).
2380	9619308	BODY51	RESULTS	157	Copy-number data showed the overall lowest correlation with gene expression when comparing genes with high range of expression.
2381	9619308	BODY52	RESULTS	158	Based on the premise that two potential key elements of precision medicine are: 1) the classification of tumors in subgroups with well-defined pathways, and 2) Omics-driven therapies (Jo et al., 2021), we tested the potential of the EPIC 850k methylome array in the context of the SCLC cell lines as pilots for expansion studies in patient samples.
2382	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	159	Regarding the classification of SCLCs, we used the “Multivariate Analyses” web tool of SclcCellMinerCDB to explore the predictive value of the EPIC array.
2383	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	160	Figure 5 displays snapshots that can be readily obtained by readers and users (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/sclccellminercdb).
2384	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	161	For NEUROD1, both promoter and gene body methylation give a highly significant prediction (p value = 1.3e-08) (Figure 5, upper left).
2385	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	162	As expected, promoter methylation (abbreviated “mth”) was negatively correlated with NEUROD1 expression.
2386	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	163	Gene body methylation (abbreviated “bmt”) is also highly correlated with NEUROD1 expression, as the NEUROD1 gene coincides with an SE (see section above and Figure 4D).
2387	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	164	Highly significant prediction is also observed for YAP1 and ASCL1 (Figure 5, middle left).
2388	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	165	In the case of YAP1, promoter methylation is highly predictive and gene body methylation is positively correlated with expression, as expected (see above) for genes not covered by an SE.
2389	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	166	For ASCL1, which is a short gene for which no gene body probes could be assigned, the predictive value of promoter methylation was very high (p value = 6.1e-10).
2390	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	167	Together, these analyses demonstrate the predictive value of the EPICmethylation array for SCLC classification based on their LTFs.
2391	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	168	Figure 5Predictive value of gene body and promoter DNA methylation to classify SCLC and assess the expression of therapeutically relevant genesThe Multivariate Analyses tool of SclcCellMinerCDB (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/sclccellminercdb) was used to generate the analyses and panels (snapshots from the website).
2392	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	169	Queried genes are listed above each panel.
2393	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	170	The bottom panel shows the SLFN11 gene body and promoter methylation as predictors for topotecan response in the 66 SCLC cell lines from the NCI-DTP database.
2394	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	171	Insets below each plot show technical details and significance for gene body methylation (bmt) and promoter methylation (mth).
2395	9619308	BODY53	RESULTS	172	Asterisks indicate statistical significance.
2396	9619308	BODY56	RESULTS	173	The predictive value of the EPIC array was tested for several therapeutically applicable genes (Figure 5, right and bottom panels).
2397	9619308	BODY56	RESULTS	174	The expression of DLL3, which is specifically expressed in ASCL1-SCLC (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020) and targeted by small molecules and radioligands (Morgensztern et al., 2019; Tully et al., 2022) can be predicted with high significance (p = 7.9e-10) by combining promoter (mth) and gene body (bmt) methylation (Figure 5, upper right).
2398	9619308	BODY56	RESULTS	175	Lack of expression of MGMT, which predicts response to temozolomide (Butler et al., 2020; Farago et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2017) is highly predicted by lack of promoter and gene body methylation (p = 2.8e-13) (Figure 5, right).
2399	9619308	BODY57	RESULTS	176	Finally, we tested the expression of SLFN11 as a sensitizer and biomarker for replication-targeted therapies commonly used in SCLC (etoposide, cisplatin, topotecan, lurbinectedin) (Jo et al., 2021; Kundu et al., 2021; Murai et al., 2019; Thomas and Pommier, 2016).
2400	9619308	BODY57	RESULTS	177	Immunoblot analyses on the NCI-DTP SCLC cell lines (Polley et al., 2016) demonstrated high correlation between SLFN11 protein levels (“proSLFN11” in Figure 5, bottom right) and gene expression (Pearson correlation (r) = 0.93, p value = 1.5e-26), which is consistent with our initial studies performed in the NCI60 (Zoppoli et al., 2012).
2401	9619308	BODY57	RESULTS	178	Next, we tested the predictive value of the EPIC array data for SLFN11 and found very high predictive value by combining promoter and gene body methylation (r = 0.82, p value = 5.9e-17) (Figure 5, bottom right).
2402	9619308	BODY57	RESULTS	179	Both parameters obtained from the EPIC array combination were also predictive of the activity of topotecan (Figure 5, bottom) with predictive value primarily driven by gene body methylation (Figure S5C) rather than promoter methylation (Figure S5D).
2403	9619308	BODY58	RESULTS	180	Together these analyses demonstrate the predictive value of the EPICmethylation data analyzed using the CellMinerCDB algorithms (Luna et al., 2021) to classify SCLC and potentially predict therapies.
2404	9619308	BODY59	CONCLUSIONS	181	The SCLC-CellMiner web portal (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/) provides a unique platform and data repository to examine multi-omics data for widely used patient-derived SCLC preclinical models with data originating from complementary sources (NCI, DepMap, UT Southwestern, Cold-spring Harbor) (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2405	9619308	BODY59	CONCLUSIONS	182	SCLC-CellMiner enables researchers to directly compare and mine gene expression patterns and pathways, and determine how gene expression and mutations may be correlated and hence “predict” response to hundreds of drugs tested in the preclinical models (Polley et al., 2016; Tlemsani et al., 2020).
2406	9619308	BODY59	CONCLUSIONS	183	Compared to our previously released version (Tlemsani et al., 2020), the updated version of SCLC-CellMiner integrates two new epigenetic markers: gene body methylation and promoter enhancer signals (H3K27ac).
2407	9619308	BODY59	CONCLUSIONS	184	These epigenetic marks, in addition to promoter methylation and gene copy number (CNV), predict gene expression, classify SCLC cell lines, and show how omics analyses predict drug responses.
2408	9619308	BODY59	CONCLUSIONS	185	These new features are summarized in Table S4.
2409	9619308	BODY60	CONCLUSIONS	186	Genomic DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1, which recognizes and methylates hemi-methylated sites during replication.
2410	9619308	BODY60	CONCLUSIONS	187	De novo DNA methylation is mainly deposited by DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which binds to histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) before methylating DNA at inactive gene promoters.
2411	9619308	BODY60	CONCLUSIONS	188	At actively transcribed genes, the promoters are marked by the trimethylation of H3K4, which inhibits the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A/B, leading to decreased promoter methylation levels (Otani et al., 2009; Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016; Zhang et al., 2010).
2412	9619308	BODY60	CONCLUSIONS	189	As genes are transcribed by POL2, SETD2 trimethylates the core histone H3 at lysine K36, which is recognized by DNMT3B, leading to hypermethylation in the gene body (Dhayalan et al., 2010; Greenberg and Bourc'his, 2019; Hervouet et al., 2018; Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015).
2413	9619308	BODY60	CONCLUSIONS	190	Gene body methylation has been proposed to enhance transcription by suppressing the firing of alternate transcripts and by facilitating splicing (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Neri et al., 2017; Teissandier and Bourc'his, 2017; Yang et al., 2014).
2414	9619308	BODY60	CONCLUSIONS	191	Apart from transcription, DNA methylation has been shown to be mutually exclusive of the facultative heterochromatin marker H3K27me3 (Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020).
2415	9619308	BODY60	CONCLUSIONS	192	In addition, differential DNA methylation status has been seen in euchromatin (A) and heterochromatin (B) compartments, where A-compartments tended to be hypermethylated (Fortin and Hansen, 2015).
2416	9619308	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	193	Our gene-level methylation profile analyses based on the high-resolution EPICmethylation 850K array demonstrate that genes expressed at high levels are characterized not only by promoter hypomethylation but also by gene body hypermethylation.
2417	9619308	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	194	The promoter hypomethylation valley is slightly narrower in lowly expressed genes paired with decreasing gene body methylation values.
2418	9619308	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	195	Because of this relationship, promoter methylation shows a negative correlation, while gene body methylation exhibits even higher positive correlation with gene expression levels.
2419	9619308	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	196	Looking at non-expressed genes, promoters and gene bodies are either both hypo- or hypermethylated.
2420	9619308	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	197	As transcription is lacking in these genes, methylation deposition may be coordinated by other epigenetic markers and chromatin states (Brinkman et al., 2012; Fortin and Hansen, 2015; Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015).
2421	9619308	BODY61	CONCLUSIONS	198	From a translational viewpoint, our methylation algorithms (mth: promoter and bmt: gene body) demonstrate the value of the DNA EPICmethylation 850K array for predicting gene expression.
2422	9619308	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	199	We also observed that DNA methylation levels are lower in enhancer areas, and that genic areas covered by super-enhancers (SEs) tend to be completely hypomethylated.
2423	9619308	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	200	This is probably related to the elevated promoter mark H3K4me3, which inhibits DNA methylation deposition that extends to wider genomic regions in super-enhancers (Cao et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2018).
2424	9619308	BODY62	CONCLUSIONS	201	This results in a counterintuitively negative correlation between expression and gene body methylation and corresponds to a signature of genes covered by super-enhancers, such as NEUROD1, FOXA1/2 and NKX2-1 (see Table S6).
2425	9619308	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	202	SCLC cell lines are classified into 4 main subtypes based on the four LTFs: ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1 (Rudin et al., 2019), and recent attempts have been made to extend this classification to clinical samples (Qu et al., 2022).
2426	9619308	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	203	Basic studies recently showed that these subtypes can be clustered using their SE activity (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021).
2427	9619308	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	204	The clustering was also visible when we used variable enhancers, not limiting to SEs.
2428	9619308	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	205	This was not surprising, as ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 binding sites have very little overlap, with elevated enhancer signal that is specific to each subtype.
2429	9619308	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	206	Additionally, DNA methylation levels are lower in the binding sites of ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 (Yin et al., 2017).
2430	9619308	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	207	Finally, we demonstrate that promoter enhancer signal levels are strong predictors of gene expression, outperforming DNA methylation and DNA methylation-derived copy-number as well.
2431	9619308	BODY63	CONCLUSIONS	208	Yet, in the absence of H3K27ac ChIP data, which is the case for clinical samples, our analyses demonstrate the potential of the DNA EPICmethylation 850K array to significantly predict gene expression and match tumors with the SCLC-LTF subgroups and with specific therapies such DLL3-based cytotoxins, temozolomide (based on lack of MGMT) and the DNA replication targeted chemotherapies (etoposide, cisplatin, camptothecin, and lurbinectedin) (based on the expression of SLFN11).
2432	9619308	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	209	Our study has some limitations: 1) DNA methylation was measured with 850K arrays and RRBS (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing), which cover more positions than the 450k array, are still limited to predetermined areas; 2) as gene body methylation is usually deposited through transcription, in cases where a gene is expressed in all cell lines, the gene body methylation level may be less predictive of expression levels (which is similarly seen in case of promoter methylation); 3) Our data are based on cancer cell line models.
2433	9619308	BODY64	CONCLUSIONS	210	Therefore, follow-up clinical studies including both RNA-seq and EPICmethylation 850K arrays are warranted to validate the predictive value of the high-resolution DNA methylation arrays in patient samples.

2487	6594009	ABS0	ABSTRACT	1	Platinum-based chemotherapy, consisting of etoposide and cisplatin (EP), has been the cornerstone of therapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) for decades.
2488	6594009	ABS0	ABSTRACT	2	Despite the marked initial sensitivity of SCLC to chemotherapy, EP regimens cannot avoid the emergence of drug resistance in clinical practice.
2489	6594009	ABS0	ABSTRACT	3	With the rise of new chemotherapy regimens in recent years and the primary resistance or insensitivity of ES-SCLC to EP regimens, it is desirable to be able to identify patients with resistant or insensitive ES-SCLC.
2490	6594009	ABS1	ABSTRACT	4	The sequencing and drug sensitivity data of SCLC cell lines were provided by The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project (GDSC).
2491	6594009	ABS1	ABSTRACT	5	The data regarding sensitivity to etoposide of 54 SCLC cell lines were analyzed, and etoposide-sensitive cell lines and etoposide-resistant cell lines were differentiated according to the IC50 values defined by the GDSC.
2492	6594009	ABS1	ABSTRACT	6	ROC curve analysis was performed on all mutations and combinations of mutations to select the optimal panel to predict resistance to etoposide.
2493	6594009	ABS2	ABSTRACT	7	ROC analysis of etoposide resistance revealed that the most significant single gene mutation indicating resistance to etoposide was CSMD3, and the accuracy of predicting resistance to etoposide proved to be the highest when there was any mutation in CSMD3/PCLO/RYR1/EPB41L3, area under the curve =0.804 (95% confidence interval: 0.679–0.930,P<0.001).
2494	6594009	ABS3	ABSTRACT	8	This study found that a panel with four genes (CSMD3, EPB41L3, PCLO, and RYR1) can accurately predict sensitivity to etoposide.
2495	6594009	ABS3	ABSTRACT	9	These findings provide new insights into the overall treatment for patients with ES-SCLC that is resistant or insensitive to etoposide.
2496	6594009	BODY0	BACKGROUND	10	In recent years, humans have made significant progress in the early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment, and even prevention of cancer.
2497	6594009	BODY0	BACKGROUND	11	However, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6%) and the leading cause of cancer-related death (18.4%) worldwide.1 Currently, there are approximately 2.1 million lung cancer patients worldwide.1 Approximately 12–15% of new lung cancer patients are diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).2,3 According to the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, an estimated 29,654 new cases of SCLC occurred in the United States in 2017.4,5 Studies have shown that the incidence of SCLC is attributable to cigarette smoking, and the smoking pack-years increases, so does the risk of SCLC.
2498	6594009	BODY0	BACKGROUND	12	Ninety percent of patients with SCLC have been or are currently smokers, and smoking duration is positively associated with an increased risk of SCLC.6,7 In addition, SCLC is characterized by a high growth fraction, a high degree of malignancy, and the early development of widespread metastases.8,9 The 5-year survival rate in patients with SCLC is only 6.6%.
2499	6594009	BODY0	BACKGROUND	13	Currently, SCLC is divided into limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC).
2500	6594009	BODY0	BACKGROUND	14	Unfortunately, the 5-year survival rates are only 1.6% and 12.1% for patients with ES-SCLC (1/3) and ES-SCLC (2/3),8–11 respectively.
2501	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	15	At present, surgery is one of the main methods of cancer treatment, but it is rarely used in the treatment of patients with SCLC.
2502	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	16	It is only suitable for a small number of stage I patients with SCLC (2%-5%) who do not have mediastinal lymph node metastasis.
2503	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	17	In the past few decades, a platinum compound in combination with the topoisomerase-II inhibitor etoposide beyond 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy (EP) has become the cornerstone of treatment for patients with ES-SCLC for palliative care.11–13 In recent years, the chemotherapy for ES-SCLC has mainly been irinotecan, cisplatin (IP) and EP regimens.14 Despite the substantial initial sensitivity of SCLC to chemotherapy in the early stages of treatment, more than 90% of patients eventually develop clinical drug resistance and die as a result of relapse.8,9 At present, there is a great deal of controversy about the therapeutic effect and safety tolerance of IP and EP in the treatment of ES-SCLC.
2504	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	18	In 2002, a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial (J9511) performed in Japan reported that patients with ES-SCLC who were treated with IP experienced a median survival of 12.8 months compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with EP (P=0.002).
2505	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	19	In addition, the 1-year survival rates were 58.4% vs 37.7% and the median progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 12.8 months vs 9.4 months in the IP and EP groups, respectively.15 Furthermore, Hermes et al studied 220 patients with ES-SCLC, and the results showed that the median overall survival (OS) was slightly higher in those receiving IP than in those receiving EP (8.5 months vs 7.1 months, P=0.04).16 However, it is surprising that there were no significant differences in the efficacy and survival of the IP and EP groups in 4 subsequent phase III trials.17–20 In a cohort study from Korea, the median OS and median PFS of patients with ES-SCLC treated with IP were 10.9 months and 6.5 months, respectively, whereas the median OS and PFS in the EP arm were 10.3 months (P=0.120) and 5.8 months (P=0.115), respectively.
2506	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	20	Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the 1- and 2-year survival rates in the IP versus EP groups.
2507	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	21	In the subgroup analysis, males, patients <65 years old and patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≤1 were treated with IP or EP, and the two groups had significant therapeutic differences.
2508	6594009	BODY1	BACKGROUND	22	In addition, there was a significant difference in the objective response rate (ORR) between the IP group and the EP group (62.4% vs 48.2%, P=0.006).21
2509	6594009	BODY2	BACKGROUND	23	Currently, 4 to 6 cycles EP is the standard therapy widely used for a majority of SCLC in the clinic, with an ORR of 50%-80%.22 However, the median OS of patients with ES-SCLC is only 9 months, with only 2% of patients surviving after 5 years.14,23 Although SCLC usually responds well to chemotherapy regimens in the early stages of treatment, subsequent clinical drug resistance and disease recurrence occur in more than 90% of patients.8,9 This may be due to the existence of cancer stem cells that are relatively resistant to cytotoxic therapy.
2510	6594009	BODY2	BACKGROUND	24	Chemotherapy cannot destroy residual tumor cells, leading to a high recurrence rate and a high drug resistance rate in SCLC.24 Primary resistance or acquired resistance to chemotherapy is a major factor in the poor prognosis of patients with lung cancer.25–27 In the drug sensitivity data from GDSC, we found that the IC50 of etoposide in the 54 SCLC cell lines ranged from 0.242 μM to 319 μM, and the drug resistance cut-off value provided by the website was 16 μM.
2511	6594009	BODY2	BACKGROUND	25	In total, 65% of patients have SCLC that is sensitive to etoposide, which is close to the response rate for etoposide.28 Therefore, if we are able to select patients with ES-SLCL that is not sensitive to etoposide before treating them with standard chemotherapy, we could choose a different chemotherapy regimen to treat these patients, hopefully improving survival outcomes in those ES-SCLC patients.
2512	6594009	BODY2	BACKGROUND	26	Survival time was significantly improved with the new chemotherapy compared with EP.
2513	6594009	BODY2	BACKGROUND	27	However, there is currently no clinically relevant prediction factor and screening for appropriate means of insensitivity to etoposide.
2514	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	28	To date, a growing number of studies have shown that the emergence of primary or acquired platinum and Topoisomerase Inhibitors resistance in EP is associated with certain gene expression changes or/and gene mutations.29 Chiu et al30 found that FBXL7 is a biomarker of poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer.
2515	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	29	A high expression level of FBXL7 is positively associated with a low survival rate in ovarian cancer patients, and the FBXL7 mRNA level and ovarian cancer cell line paclitaxel (PTX) IC50 values were positively correlated, leading to the speculation that the upregulation of FBXL7 expression results in resistant ovarian cancer cell lines.
2516	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	30	In addition, Chiu et al31 detected the transcriptional level of the shared gene in HCC38 (PTX-sensitive) and MDA-MB436 (PTX-resistant) TNBC cells posttreatment with paclitaxel.
2517	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	31	They found that the downregulation of miR-1180 may regulate OTUD7B, ultimately negatively regulating the NF-κB-Lin28 axis.
2518	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	32	This in turn triggers Let-7 microRNA-mediated caspase-3 downregulation, ultimately leading to resistance to PTX.
2519	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	33	Based on these findings, the sensitivity and drug resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy can be predicted by gene expression levels.
2520	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	34	Thus, patients with ES-SLCL that is sensitive or insensitive to chemotherapy can be further distinguished.
2521	6594009	BODY3	BACKGROUND	35	We hope that the sensitivity of ES-SCLC to etoposide can be predicted by gene mutation panels, allowing the selection of patients with ES-SCLC that is insensitive to etoposide before standard chemotherapy is administered and the development of personalized, precise chemotherapy to extend patients’ OS and improve their quality of life (QOL).
2522	6594009	BODY4	BACKGROUND	36	To this end, we analyzed the sequencing and drug sensitivity data for a SCLC cell line through the GDSC database to determine whether mutations can predict the primary resistance to etoposide and try to explain the potential underlying mechanism to provide first-line treatment recommendations for patients with ES-SCLC.
2523	6594009	BODY5	METHODS	37	The natural logarithm half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of all selected erlotinib-related cell lines were obtained from the GDSC (https://www.cancerrxgene.org/).
2524	6594009	BODY5	METHODS	38	Robust Multichip Average (RMA) normalized expression data from the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 array and gene mutation information found in cell lines by Illumina HiSeq 2000 whole-exome sequencing (WES) were downloaded from the GDSC.
2525	6594009	BODY6	METHODS	39	There were 54 SCLC cell lines in the GDSC with drug sensitivity data for etoposide.
2526	6594009	BODY6	METHODS	40	The GDSC site defined etoposide-resistant cell lines as those with IC50 values ≥16 μM and etoposide-sensitive cell lines as those with IC50 values <16 μM.
2527	6594009	BODY6	METHODS	41	ROC curve analysis was performed for all mutations, and the cell lines with areas under the curve (AUCs) >0.5 were selected and randomly combined; then, resistance to etoposide was predicted by the combined mutation panels.
2528	6594009	BODY6	METHODS	42	The Youden Index values obtained by various combined ROC analyses were sorted to select the best combination.
2529	6594009	BODY7	METHODS	43	The IC50 distribution for etoposide in various cell lines was obtained with the GDSC web tool.
2530	6594009	BODY7	METHODS	44	ROC analysis and mapping were performed with SPSS 21.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation); mutation and gene expression data were analyzed and mapped with the maftools32 and limma packages33 in R. In the differential analysis of the gene expression profiles, P<0.05 and FC>1.5 orFC<2/3 were considered to indicate significant differences.
2531	6594009	BODY7	METHODS	45	The survival analysis was with the log-rank test after the Kaplan-Meier analysis to investigate the predictive ability of a mutation panel with regard to survival.
2532	6594009	BODY7	METHODS	46	Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in this study were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/).
2533	6594009	BODY8	RESULTS	47	The sensitivity of cancer cell lines to drugs is mainly expressed as the IC50 value, which refers to the concentration of drug that kills half of the tumor cells in vitro.
2534	6594009	BODY8	RESULTS	48	Because the drug concentration is diluted to 1/10 or 1/100, we used lnIC50 values to distinguish between resistant or sensitive cell lines.
2535	6594009	BODY8	RESULTS	49	Based on the GDCS 7.0 database (updated on March 20, 2018), there are 64 SCLC cell lines, but only 54 of them have etoposide susceptibility data (drug sensitivity data), WES mutation data and RNA Seq data.
2536	6594009	BODY9	RESULTS	50	Using the GDSC website tools, we obtained the IC50 distribution for etoposide by tissue type (Figure 1A).
2537	6594009	BODY9	RESULTS	51	We found that most of the tumors are sensitive to etoposide, and the IC50 values of most cell SCLC lines indicate that they are sensitive to etoposide.
2538	6594009	BODY9	RESULTS	52	By analyzing the IC50 values of the 54 SCLC cell lines shown in Figure 1B, we found that there are 35 cell lines that are sensitive to etoposide, accounting for 64.8% of the total, and their median and mean IC50 values were 2.06 μM (range: 0.242–15.2 μM) and 4.02±4.07 μM, respectively.
2539	6594009	BODY9	RESULTS	53	In total, 19 strains were resistant to etoposide, accounting for 35.2% of the total, and their median and mean IC50 values were 50.0 μM (range: 16.4–319.0 μM) and 71.9±71.8 μM, respectively.
2540	6594009	BODY9	RESULTS	54	The raw data for the IC50 values of all cell lines with regard to etoposide can be found in Table S1.

2548	6594009	BODY15	RESULTS	62	We performed an ROC analysis of to predict etoposide resistance using all mutated genes (see Table S2).
2549	6594009	BODY15	RESULTS	63	From the ROC curves, we found that the most significant single gene mutation associated with resistance to etoposide was CSMD3, with an AUC of 0.697 (P=0.016) (Table 1).
2550	6594009	BODY15	RESULTS	64	By experimenting with different combinations, we found that when any mutations occurred in CSMD3/PCLO/RYR1/EPB41L3, the accuracy of predicting resistance to etoposide was the highest (AUC=0.804, 95% CI: 0.679–0.930, P<0.001) (Table 1).

2552	6594009	BODY19	RESULTS	66	We performed a log-rank test with the Kaplan–Meier plots according to mutations and clinical follow-up data in 110 SCLCs published by George et al34 In addition, we found a significantly lower average survival time in patients with CLC with any mutation in CSMD3/PCLO/RYR1/EPB41L3 than in those with no mutations in all four genes (35.6±5.3 months vs 76.7±12.1 months, P=0.040) (Figure 3B).
2553	6594009	BODY19	RESULTS	67	By analyzing significantly enriched KEGG pathways of DEGs, we found that there was a significant association between both CSMD3 and RYR1 mutations and MAPK signaling pathway (P=0.015 and P=0.023, respectively) (Table 2).

2555	6594009	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	69	EP has been the most common therapy for ES-SCLC for decades.
2556	6594009	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	70	As a standard treatment, it can inhibit tumor proliferation, relieve clinical symptoms, and achieve ideal results.13,34–37 We found that 19 (35.2%) of the 54 SCLC cell lines were insensitive to etoposide according to the data from the GDSC.
2557	6594009	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	71	Currently, the clinically accepted ORR of EP is 50–80%.23 Based on the above findings, the majority of patients with SCLC do not receive survival benefits from EP, indicating that screening for patients with primary resistance to etoposide is necessary.
2558	6594009	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	72	Therefore, this study further analyzed the mutation, gene expression and etoposide sensitivity data of 54 ES-SCLC cell lines obtained from the GDSC.
2559	6594009	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	73	We identified four genes, namely, CSMD3, EPB41L3, PCLO, and RYR1; mutations in these genes predict resistance to etoposide.
2560	6594009	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	74	The predictive sensitivity this four-gene panel for resistance to etoposide is as high as 85%, with 77.8% accuracy when screening for patients with primary etoposide resistance.
2561	6594009	BODY22	CONCLUSIONS	75	In addition, the ROC showed an AUC of 0.804 (95% CI 0.679–0.930), and the model was considered to have a high degree of confidence.
2562	6594009	BODY23	CONCLUSIONS	76	Recently, a small phase III trial performed in Japan compared the efficacy of IP and EP in patients with ES-SCLC15. The trial results showed a higher median OS (12.8 months vs 9.4 months), 1-year survival rate (58.4% vs 37.7%) and 2-year survival rate (19.5% vs 5.2%) after IP than after EP.
2563	6594009	BODY23	CONCLUSIONS	77	In addition, Hermes et al16 studied 220 patients with ES-SCLC, and the results showed a longer median OS resulting from the IP regimen compared with the EP regimen (8.5 months vs 7.1 months, P=0.04).
2564	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	78	We analyzed the data and found that mutations in both CSMD3 and RYR1 can cause the activation of the downstream MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 4).
2565	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	79	In addition, Liu et al36 found that etoposide activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, inhibits p53 expression and enhances c-Myc expression to decrease the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy in.
2566	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	80	Therefore, we hypothesized that mutations in the CSMD3 and RYR1 genes may cause a significant resistance to etoposide in ES-SCLC via the downstream MAPK signaling pathway.
2567	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	81	It is well known that etoposide induces DNA double-strand breakage (DSB) and triggers the DNA damage response by activating the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) DNA repair is a process of energy dissipation, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes participate in DSB repair.37 In aerobic conditions, tumor cells preferentially perform glycolysis rather than providing energy for cell growth through the more efficient oxidative phosphorylation pathway and are therefore characterized by high glucose uptake, glycolysis activity levels and lactic acid content in the metabolites.
2568	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	82	Glycolysis consumes more glucose but produces less ATP.38 The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis by upregulating cell surface glucose transporters39 and glycolytic enzymes in tumor cells.40,41 Surprisingly, we found that the mutation of the EPB41L3 gene caused increased activity of the glucose metabolism pathway in tumor cells.
2569	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	83	Therefore, we speculate that mutations in EPB41L3 may reduce sensitivity to etoposide through DNA repair in tumor cells.
2570	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	84	In addition, AKT is involved in the repair of DNA damage caused by genotoxicity, mainly by the action of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the kinase ATM/ATM and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) to repair DSB.42 Makinoshima et al43 found that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling inhibitors can effectively inhibit the expression of GLUT1 on the cell membrane.
2571	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	85	They used RNAi to interfere with the expression of GLUT1, ultimately reducing the aerobic glycolysis process and cell proliferation rate.
2572	6594009	BODY24	CONCLUSIONS	86	Furthermore, our results suggest that PCLO mutations cause activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, so we hypothesized that PCLO mutations may enhance glucose metabolism by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby enhance the ability of the tumor cell to repair DNA.Figure 4Potential mechanism of the four-gene panel to predict the resistance of etoposide in SCLC.Abbreviation: SCLC, small-cell lung cancer.
2573	6594009	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	87	Identifying outpatients with ES-SCLC that is not sensitive to etoposide and treating them with another combination therapy are important steps in improving the survival of patients with SCLC.
2574	6594009	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	88	Screening for the sensitivity to etoposide in patients with SCLC who are receiving chemotherapy for the first time allows clinicians to use a different combination chemotherapy regimen (Table 3) in these patients to avoid treatment failure due to primary resistance to etoposide.
2575	6594009	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	89	Currently, alternative treatment options that are commonly used in clinical practice include IP protocols, platinum-based drugs plus paclitaxel, and IP plus sunitinib.
2576	6594009	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	90	A phase II clinical trial (NCT00454324) on the use of a platinum-based compound plus paclitaxel in patients with ES-SCLC has shown good efficacy.44 In a phase II clinical trial (NCT00695292),45 sunitinib combined with IP for patients with ES-SCLC showed potential clinical efficacy and safety, with an ORR of 59%, a one-year survival rate of 54% and a median PFS of 7.6 months.
2577	6594009	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	91	In recent years, combinations of various chemotherapy regimens have been shown to provide excellent survival advantages in patients with ES-SCLC.
2578	6594009	BODY27	CONCLUSIONS	92	It may be possible to classify patients by adding inclusion criteria and then use a more specific new chemotherapy regimen as a clinical treatment to achieve individualized and precise treatment of ES-SCLC patients, overcoming the treatment bottleneck for patients with ES-SCLC that is resistant to EP and ultimately prolonging their survival time and improving their QOL.Table 3Completed/ongoing clinical trials of alternative treatment of etoposide in SCLC patientsDrug nameClincal phaseCommentsNCT No.

2580	6594009	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	94	There were some limitations in this study.
2581	6594009	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	95	First, the most suitable alternative drug at present is irinotecan.
2582	6594009	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	96	GDSC does not provide data regarding the sensitivity to irinotecan, and the sensitivity of etoposide-resistant ES-SCLC to irinotecan is still unclear.
2583	6594009	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	97	Second, currently, there are no suitable large-sample clinical datasets that directly support our conclusions, and relevant clinical research needs to be further conducted to verify our hypothesis; moreover, we have initialed a clinical trial(NCT03162705) and hope this onging clincal trial could provide more direct evidence onni.
2584	6594009	BODY30	CONCLUSIONS	98	Third, the accuracy of the model prediction is inadequate, and it may be necessary to expand the model to optimize it.
2585	6594009	BODY31	CONCLUSIONS	99	In conclusion, we analyzed the mutation and gene expression data from the GDSC of 54 ES-SCLC cell lines with regard to etoposide susceptibility and found that the panel including CSMD3, EPB41L3, PCLO, and RYR1 can likely predict the sensitivity of ES-SCLC to etoposide and, therefore, the clinical survival of patients with SCLC.
