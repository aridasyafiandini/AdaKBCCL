1	9972901	ABS0	['SUMMARY']	ABSTRACT	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lethal form of lung cancer. Here, we develop a quantitative multiplexed approach on the basis of lentiviral barcoding with somatic CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing to functionally investigate candidate regulators of tumor initiation and growth in genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC. We found that naphthalene pre-treatment enhances lentiviral vector-mediated SCLC initiation, enabling high multiplicity of tumor clones for analysis through high-throughput sequencing methods. Candidate drivers of SCLC identified from a meta-analysis across multiple human SCLC genomic datasets were tested using this approach, which defines both positive and detrimental impacts of inactivating 40 genes across candidate pathways on SCLC development. This analysis and subsequent validation in human SCLC cells establish TSC1 in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway as a robust tumor suppressor in SCLC. This approach should illuminate drivers of SCLC, facilitate the development of precision therapies for defined SCLC genotypes, and identify therapeutic targets.

3	9972901	ABS2	['IN BRIEF']	ABSTRACT	Lee et al. report a meta-analysis of published genomic studies to identify candidate drivers of SCLC development in patients. They implement a genetic screening approach in mouse models of SCLC to functionally validate mTOR signaling as a key driver of SCLC development, including the TSC1 tumor suppressor.
4	9972901	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) constitutes about 15% of all lung cancers and is one of the most aggressive forms of human cancer.1-3 Mortality in SCLC remains high, with a median survival of 8–10 months, as SCLC tumors are highly metastatic and become rapidly resistant to therapeutic approaches.4 The malignancy of SCLC cells is at least in part encoded by the complexity of genomic alterations induced by cigarette smoking.5 A major goal in the field has been to identify genetic drivers of SCLC growth, with the intent of eventually mirroring the successes with targeted therapies achieved in lung adenocarcinoma.6
5	9972901	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Inactivation of the TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressor genes is a near universal event in SCLC. Other recurrent alterations in SCLC genomes include inactivation of tumor suppressors such as NOTCH family members or the MLL2 chromatin remodeler, and amplification of oncogenes such as MYC family transcription factors.5,7,8 Because of the high tumor mutation burden (TMB) in SCLC cells, however, distinguishing driver alterations from passengers remains challenging. For instance, KMT2D (encoding MLL2) is among the largest genes (>40 kb) in the human genome; consequently, mutations within this gene have not been classified as putative drivers in the largest published genomic analyses of SCLC.5 However, functional analyses strongly suggest that MLL2 loss is an important driver of SCLC.8,9
6	9972901	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Genetically engineered mouse models of cancer provide a platform with which candidate cancer driver alterations can be functionally interrogated in a relevant in vivo context. The development of SCLC mouse models that recapitulate the inactivation of TP53 and RB1 in human SCLC has enabled the investigation of the role of additional candidate drivers of SCLC.10-12 However, thus far, progress in functionally validating potential driver mutations has been slow, with only a limited number of genes being tested since the first mouse model of SCLC was developed close to 20 years ago.7,11,13-18
7	9972901	BODY3	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Almost all genetically engineered mouse models of SCLC entail tumor initiation via the delivery of the Cre recombinase by an adenoviral vector (Ad-Cre) to delete conditional mutant alleles of Rb1 and Trp53.7,11-13,19 Notably, adenoviral vectors do not integrate into the DNA of the transduced cells. Although this may be beneficial in synchronizing the time of tumor initiation, it is unsuitable for experimental studies in which sustained transgene expression or genetic tagging of transduced cells is required. The recent development of Tuba-seq (tumor barcoding with ultradeep barcode sequencing) has enabled the functional investigation of pools of putative driver genes in a quantitative and scalable manner in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma.20,21 In this approach, each cell transduced by a lentiviral-Cre vector (Lenti-sgRNA/Cre) and its descendants are stably labeled with a clonal identifier in the form of a random DNA barcode (BC) as well as a vector-specific identifier to distinctly label each unique genetic perturbation (i.e., sgRNA-ID or sgID). Thus, the importance of each sgRNA-targeted gene during tumor initiation and growth can be studied quantitatively. Furthermore, the presence of sgID allows simultaneous testing of multiple sgRNAs in one mouse with a pool of multiple lentiviral vectors. Although the Tuba-seq pipeline is in theory generalizable to any in vivo model that is amenable to lentiviral transduction and relies upon a conditionally regulated tumorigenic program, it has not yet been applied to study the genetic underpinnings of SCLC development.
8	9972901	BODY4	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Here we present a barcoded Lenti-Cre-based mouse model of SCLC, which allows tracking of SCLC tumor clones that develop entirely within the native environment. We show that pre-treatment with naphthalene is key to efficient initiation of SCLC using lentiviral vectors, which enables the analysis of many tumor genotypes with Tuba-seq. We quantitatively assessed the impact of 40 genes on the initiation and growth of SCLC in a minimal number of mice. Our work validates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway as an important driver of SCLC development and demonstrates a key role for TSC1 in this pathway as a potent tumor suppressor in SCLC.
9	9972901	BODY5	['RESULTS', 'NAPHTHALENE TREATMENT ENHANCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCLC IN MICE']	RESULTS	Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl;Rbl2fl/fl (RPR2 or TKO [triple knockout]) mice model the most prevalent subtype of human SCLC (SCLC-A, with high expression of ASCL122). In this mouse model, tumor initiation is efficient and tumor progression relatively rapid (4–6 months) following intratracheal instillation with Ad-CMV-Cre.11,23 Although RPR2;R26LSL-tdTomato (RPR2T) mice developed SCLC upon transduction with Lenti-Cre (HIV-PGK-Cre backbone) (Figures 1A-1C), the overall tumor numbers were much lower than in RPR2 mutant mice using Ad-CMV-Cre despite similar titers (Table S1).11 Naphthalene is a compound that kills most club cells in the lung epithelium.24 On the basis of a previous report using naphthalene prior to lentiviral transduction to generate lung tumors in mice,25 we injected RPR2T mice with either naphthalene or vehicle (corn oil) two days prior to intratracheal delivery of Lenti-Cre (Figure 1A). Naphthalene pre-treatment significantly increased both tumor number and burden in this context (Figures 1B and 1C). Importantly, Lenti-Cre-initiated tumors showed histopathological characteristics of SCLC-A tumors, including high expression of ASCL1 and the neuroendocrine marker UCHL1 (Figures 1D, 1E, and S1A). Tumors initiated using a different Lenti-Cre vector backbone (FIV-CMV-Cre) showed similar SCLC-A histology (Figure S1B). In contrast to naphthalene pre-treatment, which increased tumor area also in the Ad-Cre model (Figures S1C and S1D), transduction with Ad-CMV-EGFP two days prior to Lenti-Cre transduction did not increase tumor number or area (Figures S1E and S1F), indicating that the pro-tumor effects of naphthalene are distinct from inflammatory responses upon adenoviral infection. Cell lines derived from RPR2T mutant tumors initiated by Ad-CMV-Cre or Lenti-Cre, with or without naphthalene treatment, formed floating clusters of cells in culture, similar to classical neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines (Figure S2A). Transcriptomic analysis confirmed expression of Ascl1 and canonical neuroendocrine markers, with low levels of other transcription factors typical of other SCLC subtypes22 (Figures 1F and 1G).
10	9972901	BODY6	['RESULTS', 'NAPHTHALENE TREATMENT ENHANCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCLC IN MICE']	RESULTS	SCLC tumors in the Ad-CMV-Cre RPR2 model can be initiated from cGRP+ neuroendocrine lung epithelial cells (the minority of tumors) as well as from another, unknown non-neuroendocrine cell type(s) of origin.26 The presence of cells with non-neuroendocrine features (i.e., expressing the club cell marker CC10 or the NOTCH target HES1) within tumors initiated after naphthalene pre-treatment and Lenti-Cre transduction suggested that these tumors likely mostly originate from the same non-neuroendocrine cell type(s) as Ad-CMV-Cre SCLC tumors26 (Figures 1D, 1E, S2B, and S2C).
11	9972901	BODY7	['RESULTS', 'NAPHTHALENE TREATMENT ENHANCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCLC IN MICE']	RESULTS	Thus, naphthalene pre-treatment enhances SCLC development in the RPR2 model. Given the potential ease with which this Lenti-Cre platform could be used to inactivate genes of interest using sgRNAs and the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we next moved on to identifying potential regulators of SCLC etiology for further study.
12	9972901	BODY8	['RESULTS', 'A META-ANALYSIS REVEALS BOTH KNOWN AND NOVEL PUTATIVE GENETIC REGULATORS OF SCLC']	RESULTS	To identify potential key drivers of SCLC pathogenesis, we performed a meta-analysis of 37 studies published prior to October 1, 2021, on human SCLC (Figure 2A). We compiled data for not only genetic but also epigenetic and transcriptomic alterations in SCLC (Table S2). This analysis identified 3,285 potential driver gene candidates that were profiled in at least 250 patients, had an alteration frequency of ≥3%, and coded for proteins with amino acid residue lengths of ≤2,000 (Tables S3 and S4). Whereas the relative rarity of SCLC tumor whole-genome/exome sequencing studies meant that many of the genes were examined in 400 patients or fewer, a number of the more highly profiled cancer-related genes benefited from larger coverage, with the total patient numbers ranging from 500 to about 2,000 (Figure 2B). As expected, in this analysis, TP53 and RB1 ranked first and second, respectively, as the most frequently altered genes in SCLC (Figure 2C). Although several top candidate genes identified in this meta-analysis, such as COL11A1 and XPC, were previously identified to be recurrently mutated in SCLC or capable of initiating lung cancer upon inactivation,27,28 others, such as HCN1, PCDH15, and ERICH3, have been studied minimally in cancer contexts and represent novel tumor suppressor gene candidates in SCLC (Figure 2C). The 3,285 candidates were enriched in signaling and cancer-related pathways (Figure 2D), including an enrichment in factors implicated in PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling (Figures 2D, S3A, S3B; Table S5). Furthermore, genes involved in DNA repair,29 Notch signaling,5 the WNT/Hippo-Merlin pathways,27 and epigenetic and transcriptional regulation8 showed high alteration rates (Figure 2E).
13	9972901	BODY9	['RESULTS', 'A META-ANALYSIS REVEALS BOTH KNOWN AND NOVEL PUTATIVE GENETIC REGULATORS OF SCLC']	RESULTS	Overall, this meta-analysis identified several candidate tumor suppressor genes and cancer pathways, most of which have not been functionally validated in SCLC (Table S6).
14	9972901	BODY10	['RESULTS', 'QUANTITATIVE ']	RESULTS	To investigate gene candidates in the pathways identified in the meta-analysis in an in vivo model of SCLC, we combined the Lenti-Cre/naphthalene platform with tumor barcoding with ultradeep barcode sequencing, an approach initially developed to uncover cancer drivers in mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma.20,21 We prioritized 40 genes from the 3,285 candidates identified in the meta-analysis, focusing on genes in key signaling pathways in SCLC (26 genes across pools 1–3; several of these genes are highlighted in Figure 2E) and novel targets with high alteration rates in patients with SCLC (14 genes in pool 4; all candidate genes tested are marked boldface type in Table S6). We transduced RPR2T;H11LSL-Cas9 (RPR2T;Cas9) mice with four independent Lenti-sgTSG/Cre pools consisting of Lenti/Cre expressing inert sgRNAs (as controls) and Lenti-sgRNA/Cre vectors targeting putative tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) chosen for further study from the meta-analysis (Figure 3A). Lungs were harvested at different time points for the different pools to identify possible optimal times for analysis, with no clear difference observed between the time points (see below).
15	9972901	BODY11	['RESULTS', 'QUANTITATIVE ']	RESULTS	Both RPR2T;Cas9 and control RPR2T mice showed robust tumor formation upon Cre delivery as evidenced by tdTomato fluorescence; RPR2T;Cas9 mice showed a trend toward increased lung weights suggestive of increased tumor burden upon loss of tumor suppressor genes (Figures 3B, 3C, S4A, and S4B). To determine gene inactivation effects on SCLC initiation and progression, we isolated genomic DNA from bulk tumor-bearing lungs, PCR-amplified and sequenced the sgID-BC region in the Lenti-sgRNA/Cre vector, and analyzed the data. A previous study using RP;Ptenfl/fl conditional knockout mice showed that PTEN is a potent suppressor of SCLC development initiated by loss of p53 and RB.13 We found that inactivation of PTEN significantly increased tumor size and number in RPR2T;Cas9 mice, indicative of a potent tumor-suppressive role even with the additional inactivation of p130. Conversely, inactivation of the essential gene Pcna decreased tumor size and number, indicating that this pipeline has the ability to uncover both genotype-specific positive and negative effects on SCLC initiation and growth (Figures 3D and 3E).30 Distinct sgRNAs targeting the same gene consistently had similar effects in RPR2T;Cas9 mice (Figures 3D and 3E). In contrast, sgRNAs targeting candidate cancer drivers had little to no effect on tumor growth in RPR2T mice lacking Cas9 (Figures S4C and S4D), as expected, indicating that sgID-BC enrichment and depletion recapitulate on-target gene inactivation activity. Quantifying tumor growth using alternative metrics showed similar results, with Pten and Tsc1 inactivation increasing tumor burden and size and Arid1a and Pcna inactivation decreasing tumor burden in RPR2T;Cas9 mice, while sgRNAs had little to no effect in RPR2T mice (Figures S5A-S5D).
16	9972901	BODY12	['RESULTS', 'QUANTITATIVE ']	RESULTS	This Tuba-seq analysis identified several new genetic modifiers of SCLC growth (Figures 3D and 3E). First, Tsc1 inactivation increased both tumor number and size, suggestive of a strong tumor suppressor role. Second, inactivation of Arid1a or Arid1b decreased tumor number and size in two independent pools, suggesting that ARID1A- and ARID1B-containing complexes normally promote rather than restrict the growth of SCLC in this genetic context. Third, inactivation of Nkx2-1 led to increased tumor number but not size, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role for this lung lineage transcription factor at the time of tumor initiation. Finally, Kdm6a inactivation increased tumor number in pool 1, which was harvested at 14 weeks following tumor initiation, but showed a more modest effect in pool 2 collected at 21 weeks following tumor initiation, suggesting that KDM6A may be a more potent tumor suppressor in early lesions in this model.
17	9972901	BODY13	['RESULTS', 'QUANTITATIVE ']	RESULTS	Taken together, these results indicate that adapting the Tuba-seq approach to an autochthonous murine model of SCLC enables identification of oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors, and greatly increases throughput of in vivo analyses.
18	9972901	BODY14	['RESULTS', 'SINGLE-GUIDE VALIDATION CONFIRMS TSC1 AS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR IN MOUSE SCLC']	RESULTS	Having observed frequent alterations in the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway in our meta-analysis (Figure 2E) and identified Tsc1 as a potent tumor suppressor gene in the RPR2 model using Tuba-seq (Figures 3D and 3E), we further investigated the role of TSC1 in SCLC. In single-guide experiments, RPR2T;Cas9 mice transduced with low titers of Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre vectors (to ensure visualization of individual tumors) (Table S1) developed both SCLC tumors and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors (giant cell lung adenocarcinoma) (Figures 4A-4C). Laser-capture microdissection followed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the sgID-BC in the Lenti-sgRNA/Cre vector showed that neighboring SCLC and NSCLC tumors arose from different clonal events (Figures S6A-S6C). Although PTEN, like TSC1, is a negative regulator of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, RPR2T;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgPten/Cre did not develop NSCLC tumors, unlike mice transduced with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre where 11 of 12 mice developed giant cell lung adenocarcinoma in addition to SCLC (Figures S7A-S7C). Although these Rb/p53/p130/Tsc1 (RPR2;Tsc1) mutant tumors provide a new model for giant cell lung adenocarcinoma, we did not investigate their biology further. The neuroendocrine SCLC compartment in the RPR2T;Cas9 mice with Tsc1 inactivation showed a trend toward increased tumor number and area compared with control RPR2T mice at this time point (Figures 4B and 4C).
19	9972901	BODY15	['RESULTS', 'SINGLE-GUIDE VALIDATION CONFIRMS TSC1 AS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR IN MOUSE SCLC']	RESULTS	A subset of the SCLC and NSCLC compartments had high levels of S6 phosphorylation compared with untransformed lung, suggesting elevated mTORC1 activity resulting from TSC1 inactivation (Figure 4C). S6 phosphorylation was also increased in Tsc1-knockout (KO) SCLC cell lines (derived from RPR2;Tsc1 tumors) compared with Tsc1-wild-type (WT) SCLC cell lines (Figures 4D, 4E, S7D, and S7E). In addition, Tsc1-KO cell lines displayed significantly higher sensitivity to pharmacological mTOR inhibition using AZD8055 compared with Tsc1-WT SCLC cell lines (Figure 4F). We further validated the tumor-suppressive function of TSC1 by re-expressing human TSC1 (hTSC1) in mouse tumor-derived cell lines via lentiviral transduction. Compared with the mouse SCLC cells expressing EGFP (as a control), SCLC cells (either wild-type or Tsc1-KO) ectopically expressing hTSC1 showed a significant decrease in their ability to expand in culture (Figures 4G, S8A, and S8B).
20	9972901	BODY16	['RESULTS', 'SINGLE-GUIDE VALIDATION CONFIRMS TSC1 AS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR IN MOUSE SCLC']	RESULTS	In the RP mouse model, Lenti-Cre initiates SCLC inefficiently even after naphthalene pre-treatment, with only 2–4 tumors visible at 42 weeks following transduction (Figures S9A and S9B). This small number of tumors and variable tumor development made quantification difficult and suggests that this mouse model may not be readily amenable to the Tuba-seq platform. RP;R26LSL-tdTomato;H11LSL-Cas9 (RPT;Cas9) mice also developed giant cell lung adenocarcinoma following transduction with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre vector (Figures S9C and S9D), suggesting a broader role for TSC1 in regulating lung cancer development in different genetic contexts in mice.
21	9972901	BODY17	['RESULTS', 'SINGLE-GUIDE VALIDATION CONFIRMS TSC1 AS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR IN MOUSE SCLC']	RESULTS	The RP and RPR2 models represent the SCLC-A subtype. In contrast, Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl;H11LSL-MycT58A (RPM) mice represent the MYC-overexpressing SCLC-N subtype (NEUROD1-high).7 We generated RP;R26LSL-tdTomato/+;H11LSL-MycT58A/LSL-Ca9 (RPMT;Cas9) mice and tested whether Tsc1 acts as a tumor suppressor in this context also. As Lenti-Cre alone generates tumors in the RPM model in only 8 weeks, we transduced RPMT;Cas9 mice without naphthalene pre-treatment (Figure S10A). Compared with RPMT;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgNeo1/Cre (Lenti-sgInert/Cre), mice transduced with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre had increased tumor number and area (Figures S10A-S10C). Of note, although RPMT;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgInert/Cre generated NEUROD1-high SCLC, as expected, there were areas of NSCLC histology in RPMT;Cas9 mice transduced with Lenti-sgTsc1/Cre, similar to our observations in the RPR2 and RP models (Figures 4A and S10D).
22	9972901	BODY18	['RESULTS', 'SINGLE-GUIDE VALIDATION CONFIRMS TSC1 AS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR IN MOUSE SCLC']	RESULTS	In all, our results indicate that TSC1 is a tumor suppressor in both ASCL1-high and NEUROD1-high subtypes of SCLC and that Tsc1 inactivation also induces NSCLC development in the RPR2, RP, and RPM genetic backgrounds.
23	9972901	BODY19	['RESULTS', 'TSC1/TSC2 ARE TUMOR SUPPRESSORS IN HUMAN SCLC']	RESULTS	Following validation of Tsc1 as a tumor suppressor gene in mouse models of SCLC, we next sought to validate the tumor-suppressive activity of TSC1 in human SCLC cells. We also investigated TSC2, the obligate partner of TSC1 within the tuberous sclerosis complex.31 We generated populations of NCI-H82 SCLC cells independently expressing six unique combinations of short epitopes (epitope-combinatorial-tag [EpicTag]32) and performed Cas9-RNA ribonucleoprotein nucleofection to generate TSC1-KO (in EpicTag 1 cells), TSC2-KO (in EpicTag 2 cells), and wild-type control cell lines (EpicTag 3–6 cells, which received non-targeting Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein) (Figures 5A and S11A). We then pooled EpicTag 1~6 NCI-H82 cells, cultured them for 21 days, and measured the relative change in epitope-tag representation using cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) (Figure 5A). In this assay, TSC1-KO and TSC2-KO cells showed significantly increased expansion relative to the wild-type cell lines, making up the majority of the pool by day 21 (Figures 5B and S11B). TSC1-KO and TSC2-KO cells also showed increased phosphorylated S6 compared with wild-type cell lines (Figures 5C and S11C). In contrast to the development of NSCLC upon loss of Tsc1 at the time of initiation in the mouse models, inactivation of TSC1 or TSC2 in NCI-H82 cells did not lead to any obvious fate change toward a non-neuroendocrine fate, with no differences observed in markers indicative of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and non-neuroendocrine differentiation (Figure S11D). TSC1-WT and TSC1-KO NCI-H82 cell lines did not show significant differences in half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in response to the AZD8055 mTORC1/2 inhibitor (Figure S11E), suggesting that TSC1 inactivation at a later stage of tumor progression may not sensitize to mTOR inhibition.
24	9972901	BODY20	['RESULTS', 'TSC1/TSC2 ARE TUMOR SUPPRESSORS IN HUMAN SCLC']	RESULTS	To further investigate TSC1 tumor-suppressive effects in SCLC, we profiled 9 human SCLC cell lines for their TSC1, TSC2, and phosphorylated S6 protein levels (Figure 5D). Two cell lines, NCI-H1694 and NCI-H146, exhibited higher levels of phosphorylated S6 compared with other human SCLC; in particular, NCI-H146 showed lower expression of TSC1. We ectopically expressed hTSC1 or EGFP in these two cell lines alongside two other cell lines with low levels of S6 phosphorylation (NCI-H526 and NCI-H446) and monitored their growth (Figure S12A). Although the phosphorylation of mTOR pathway members did not change significantly following ectopic expression of hTSC1 under the conditions examined, hTSC1-expressing human SCLC cell lines nonetheless showed significantly slower growth compared with EGFP-expressing controls (Figures 5E and S12B). Overall, these results validate TSC1 as a tumor suppressor in human SCLC.
25	9972901	BODY21	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	In this study, we adapted a multiplexed and quantitative method to perform medium-throughput analysis of gene inactivation in mouse models of SCLC. Using this approach, we identified TSC1 as a potent tumor suppressor in SCLC. The implementation of the Tuba-seq platform to mouse models of SCLC will greatly accelerate the functional analysis of candidate drivers of SCLC initiation and growth in vivo.
26	9972901	BODY22	['DISCUSSION', 'MULTIPLEXED GENE KNOCKOUTS IN MOUSE MODELS TO INVESTIGATE CANDIDATE TUMOR SUPPRESSORS AND GENETIC HETEROGENEITY IN SCLC']	CONCLUSIONS	Lentiviral barcoding approaches have enabled breakthroughs in understanding tumor heterogeneity, clonal evolution, and multiplexed gene perturbation effects.33-35 In this study, we show that several advantages of lentiviral barcoding (e.g., multiplexed CRISPR screening and clonality analysis using barcoding approaches) can be captured in an autochthonous, in vivo context to study SCLC development. The application of Tuba-seq to mouse models of SCLC allowed us to investigate the gene perturbation effects at a much faster rate than previously capable. However, the lack of histological information (as exemplified with Tsc1 loss and the appearance of a giant cell carcinoma phenotype) and necessity for single-guide validation remain limitations of this approach. Nonetheless, the cost and time savings from using this approach to identify SCLC drivers cannot be overstated, and future approaches could take advantage of the lentiviral barcoding further, tracking metastasis drivers and dissecting tumor clonal evolution, for instance.
27	9972901	BODY23	['DISCUSSION', 'MULTIPLEXED GENE KNOCKOUTS IN MOUSE MODELS TO INVESTIGATE CANDIDATE TUMOR SUPPRESSORS AND GENETIC HETEROGENEITY IN SCLC']	CONCLUSIONS	Although the MSK-IMPACT panel remains a major resource for cancer genomics, including SCLC, its focus on readily actionable cancer targets (341–468 genes) is a limitation.36,37 We sought to supplement and extend the currently available dataset in our meta-analysis from 37 different studies by adding more whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing studies in addition to studies profiling specific sets of genes. Because we aggregated our datasets for the sake of simplicity rather than keeping the individual patient IDs intact (i.e., keeping only the total number of patients with a given alteration in a gene), the cBioPortal remains a distinct resource for examining mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence patterns. Nonetheless, our meta-analysis database simplifies the search for novel cancer drivers by organizing aggregated patient alteration data alongside other useful metrics such as protein information for coding genes, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression datasets, and dependency scores from the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) project.
28	9972901	BODY24	['DISCUSSION', 'MULTIPLEXED GENE KNOCKOUTS IN MOUSE MODELS TO INVESTIGATE CANDIDATE TUMOR SUPPRESSORS AND GENETIC HETEROGENEITY IN SCLC']	CONCLUSIONS	Increasing evidence from human tumor sections and mouse models indicates that intra-tumoral heterogeneity on the basis of epigenetic/transcriptional program in SCLC cells plays a significant role in the growth of SCLC tumors and their response to treatment.10,38-41 In contrast, our understanding of the genetic determinants of SCLC development has been hampered by limited tumor samples and the complex genome of these tumors. The development of medium-throughput pre-clinical approaches such as described here will contribute to a more rapid functional validation of genes and pathways relevant to SCLC in the clinic. A future goal of the field will be to explore how epigenetic and genetic mechanisms together mold SCLC development and response to various therapies to identify more personalized treatment strategies.
29	9972901	BODY25	['DISCUSSION', 'THE TSC1/2-MTOR PATHWAY IN SCLC']	CONCLUSIONS	TSC1, alongside its complex partner TSC2, was first identified as a key gene whose mutation causes tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).42 TSC patients present with several clinical features, including skin lesions, hamartomas, and subependymal giant cell tumor of the brain.42 The development of tumors in TSC patients, particularly giant cell tumors, is thought to stem from TSC1-TSC2 complex’s role as a negative regulator of the mTOR pathway, which controls multiple pathways including cell growth.43-45 We observed mTORCI activation and development of giant cell carcinoma of the lung upon Tsc1 inactivation in our mouse models of SCLC. In a recent preprint describing 3,600 SCLC tumor specimens analyzed for genomic alterations in ~300 cancer genes, ~1.5% and 0.7% of patients displayed alterations in TSC1 and TSC2, respectively.46 As we did not examine events such as silencing due to methylation or complex chromosomal rearrangements, it is possible that these percentages underestimate the prevalence of TSC1/TSC2 alteration in SCLC patients. Although only about 3%–4% of SCLC patients have TSC1 alterations according to our meta-analysis, a substantial fraction of SCLC patients possess PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway alterations (e.g., 9%–10% patients with TSC2 alterations, 11%–12% with PTEN alterations). Although cases of combined SCLC/giant cell carcinoma of the lung are rare in the clinic,47,48 our data suggest that these tumors may arise from dysregulation of the TSC1/TSC2-mTOR axis alongside RB/p53 loss of function.
30	9972901	BODY26	['DISCUSSION', 'THE TSC1/2-MTOR PATHWAY IN SCLC']	CONCLUSIONS	Our data in mice and human cells show the strong tumor-suppressive role of TSC1 in SCLC, as suggested by previous in vitro CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in mouse SCLC cell lines.49 Several recent pre-clinical studies using SCLC models have also indicated that mTOR inhibition could be a viable strategy to treat SCLC patients, especially those resistant to chemotherapy. Although rapamycin analogs (e.g., temsirolimus and RAD001), which preferentially inhibit mTORC1 rather than mTORC2, were met with little success in phase II clinical trials,50,51 ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors (e.g., AZD8055), which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, may be more promising. mTOR inhibition using AZD8055 led to decreased tumor growth and sensitization to cisplatin/etoposide therapy in a subset of patient-derived xenograft models,52 and RICTOR amplification, which occurs in 10%–15% of SCLC patients, was also shown to predict response to mTOR inhibitors in SCLC cell lines.53 Data from our study with mouse cell lines further suggest that AZD8055 may produce greater therapeutic benefit for patients whose tumors lost TSC1 function early in the course of their disease. Furthermore, mTOR inhibition rescued the efficacy of Bcl-2 inhibition as well as WEE1 inhibition in in vivo models of SCLC,54,55 leading to an ongoing phase I/II clinical trial (NCT03366103). Taken together with our data, these results suggest that ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors may produce therapeutic benefit in patients with alterations in the PI3K-AKT-TSC1/2-mTOR axis.
31	9972901	BODY27	['DISCUSSION', 'LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY']	CONCLUSIONS	Aside from TSC1, most of the driver gene candidates tested in this study did not score significantly in the Tuba-seq analysis. Although it is possible that the non-scoring genes are truly passengers, three other possible explanations exist for the high prevalence of non-scoring genes: (1) the loss of Rbl2 in the RPR2 model is already such a strong tumor-suppressive event that it masks the tumor growth effects of knocking out other tumor suppressor genes; (2) alterations in some genes/pathways are strong drivers of SCLC development (e.g., loss of RB, loss of p53, activation of the MYC family, alterations in the PTEN pathway), whereas others have more minor roles that our approach did not detect at the time point examined; and (3) some alterations may play a larger (or different) role during tumor progression rather than tumor initiation. ARID1A, for example, has been shown to play a context-dependent role in liver cancer, where homozygous loss at initiation protected against HCC initiation but loss following initiation accelerated tumor growth and metastasis.56 Because our model possesses CRISPR-Cas9 activity at tumor initiation, the decrease in tumor size and number with sgRNAs against Arid1a and Arid1b is suggestive of a similar necessity for BAF complex activity at SCLC initiation and not necessarily indicative of their activity during progression. This difficulty in uncoupling the effect of gene inactivation at initiation with its role at progression may limit our interpretation of the roles that non-scoring candidate drivers may play in SCLC progression. Future studies, including investigating additional time points during cancer progression, are needed to uncover whether ARID1A/ARID1B and any of the non-scoring proposed candidate drivers show context-dependent or more nuanced roles in SCLC initiation and progression.

In a 96-well v-bottom plate, 3 μL of the sgRNA (total 300 pmol) was added to 12 μL of SE buffer (Lonza V4XC-1032). In another well, 0.5 μL of Alt-R® S.p. Cas9 (Integrated DNA Technologies 1081059) was added to 10 μL of SE buffer, and the Cas9 mix was added to the sgRNA solution, mixed thoroughly, and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes to form the RNP solution. 1 × 106 NCI-H82 cells were resuspended in 5 μL of SE Buffer, and cells were nucleofected with Lonza 4D-Nucleofector™ X Unit (Lonza AAF-1002X) with the EN150 program immediately following addition of the RNP solution. Following the nucleofection, warm RPMI media was added to the cells, and cells were incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes then transferred to a 24-well plate.
43	9972901	BODY39	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'CELL PREPARATION FOR CYTOF']	CONCLUSIONS	Frozen cell lines in RPMI media supplemented with 10% BGS and 10% DMSO (Fisher Scientific BP231) were thawed, and 3 million cells per sample were washed once with PBS. The cells were then fixed with 1.6% formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 minutes. We are using palladium (Pd) barcoding to pool up to 20 different samples and reduce tube-to-tube variability. Therefore, cells were washed twice with PBS before permeabilization with PBS and 0.02% Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich 84510) at 4°C. 11 μL of Pd barcode was added to 1 mL of PBS and 0.02% Saponin, of which 900 μL were used to resuspend each sample. This mix was incubated at room temperature for 15 min, washed three times with Cell Staining Media (CSM, PBS with 0.5% BSA (Thermo Fisher Scientific B14), 0.02% NaN3 (Fisher Scientific MP210289110)), and then pooled into a single tube for staining with metal-labeled antibodies (Table S8) for 1 hour at room temperature. Antibodies against Flag, mCherry, GFP, VSV, NWS, Prot C, Ha, AU1, Synaptophysin, Vimentin, S6, GMNN, EZH2, pYAP, CDT1, pI3K, HES1 were conjugated with MAXPAR X8 Multimetal Labeling Kit (Fluidigm 201300) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Antibodies were diluted to 0.2 μg/mL and titered. Cells were stained with a range of 1:100 to 1:200 with each of the different antibodies in a staining volume of 150 μL (~3 × 106 cells/mL). After antibody staining, the cells were washed twice with CSM and then incubated overnight at 4°C with an iridium-containing intercalator (Fluidigm 201192B) in PBS with 1.6% formaldehyde. The cells were then washed twice with water, diluted with water and 10 μL/mL EU Four Element Calibration Beads (Fluidigm 201078) to ~106 cells/mL, and filtered through a 70-μm membrane (Falcon 352350) just before analysis by mass cytometry.
44	9972901	BODY40	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'LENTIVIRAL VECTOR GENERATION AND TITERING']	CONCLUSIONS	Lentiviral vectors containing individual sgRNAs, barcode sequences, and Cre recombinase were generated as previously described, using unbarcoded Lenti-U6-sgNeo1/PGK-Cre vector as the template.20 Briefly, sgRNA sequences were picked based on an aggregated score from top hits on Desktop Genetics (formerly www.deskgen.com) and GPP sgRNA Designer offered by the Broad Institute (https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/analysis-tools/sgrna-design). Several of the sgRNAs used have been validated in previous studies.20,59-62 Detailed sgRNA and barcoding primer sequence information can be found in Table S9. Lenti-sgRNA/Cre plasmids were barcoded individually with an 8-nucleotide ID specific to each sgRNA (sgID) and 20-nucleotide random barcode sequence (BC), and each plasmid was packaged separately in 293T cells via co-transfection with polyethylenimine alongside pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene #8454) envelope plasmid and pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (Addgene #8455) packaging plasmid.58 Sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich B5587-5G) was added eight hours following the transfection to increase viral titer. Viral supernatant was collected at 48 and 60 hour time points following transfection, filtered using 0.45 μm PES syringe filter (Millipore SLHP033RB), concentrated via ultracentrifugation at 25,000 RPM for 90 minutes at 4°C, resuspended in PBS overnight, and titered using LSL-YFP mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) as previously described.20

Plasmids were co-transfected and packaged in the same way as the Lenti-sgRNA/Cre plasmids, with some differences: 1) sodium butyrate was not added and 2) the viral supernatant was collected at a 72-hour time point and added directly to the cells to be transduced after being filtered using 0.45 μm PES syringe filter.
46	9972901	BODY42	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'HISTOLOGY, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE']	CONCLUSIONS	Mouse tissues were dissected from animals immediately following euthanasia. Lungs were inflated with 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), and all tissues were fixed in 10% NBF overnight following a brief rinse in PBS. Tissues were transferred to 70% ethanol prior to paraffin embedding and processing.
47	9972901	BODY43	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'HISTOLOGY, IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY, AND IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE']	CONCLUSIONS	Prior to immunohistochemistry, paraffin sections were rehydrated by 5-minute serial immersion in Histo-Clear, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and water. Antigen retrieval was performed by immersing rehydrated slides in citrate-based antigen unmasking solution (H-3300, Vector Laboratories) at boiling temperature for 15 minutes. To block endogenous peroxidase activity, the slides were then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 1 hour. Slides were washed in PBS-T (PBS +0.1% Tween-20), blocked using blocking buffer (5% horse serum in PBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. Following incubation, slides were washed in PBS-T, incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature, and developed using DAB reagent (Vector Laboratories SK-4100) following another series of PBS-T washes. For HES1, ImmPRESS® Excel Amplified Polymer Staining Kit, Anti-Rabbit IgG, Peroxidase (Vector Laboratories MP-7601) or TSA Plus Fluorescein kit (Akoya Biosciences NEL741001KT) were used to amplify signal for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence, respectively. Following development, slides were counterstained using hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich HHS32), dehydrated by 5-minute serial immersions in 70% ethanol, 100% ethanol and xylene, and mounted with Refrax Mounting Medium (Anatech Ltd 711).

50	9972901	BODY46	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'QUANTITATIVE IMMUNOASSAY ANALYSIS']	CONCLUSIONS	Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% NP40, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl) supplemented with cOmplete™ ULTRA Protease Inhibitor Cocktail tablets (Roche 5892970001) and PhosSTOP™ phosphatase inhibitor tablets (Roche 4906845001). Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit was used to quantify total protein concentration (Thermo Fisher Scientific 23227). For quantitative immunoassays, Simple Western™ assay was performed on the Wes™ system (ProteinSimple) according to manufacturer’s protocol, with 1 μg of protein loaded per lane. Primary antibodies against the protein of interest and a loading control protein were run simultaneously in each lane. Compass for SW (v5.0.1, SimpleWestern) software was used for protein quantification and size determination. The authors note that the protein sizes tend to run larger on the Wes system compared to traditional immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used: anti-HSP90 (CST 4877, 1:4,000), anti-TSC1 (D43E2, CST 6935, 1:200), anti-TSC2 (D93F12, CST 4308), anti-S6 (CST 2217, 1:200), anti-phospho-S6 (Ser235/236, CST 2211, 1:200), anti-GFP (D5.1, CST 2956, 1:200), anti-p-mTOR (D9C2, Ser2448, CST 55365, 1:200), anti-mTOR (CST 2972, 1:200), anti-phospho-4E-BP1 (Ser65, CST 9451, 1:200), and anti-4E-BP1 (53H11, CST 9644, 1:200).
51	9972901	BODY47	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'LITERATURE META-ANALYSIS']	CONCLUSIONS	Primary studies containing SCLC-specific alteration data were collated according to data availability and alteration profiling method. The patient and alteration counts for each gene were collected from data tables associated with the study where available. For studies without such data tables, the counts were determined by manual annotation of the OncoPrint figures. To determine the number of patients with alteration(s) as well as the total number of patients profiled for each gene, each of the two numbers were summed across all studies, and these two numbers were used to estimate the proportion of SCLC patients possessing an alteration for a given gene. The protein name and amino acid length associated with each gene were obtained through a UniProt DB query, and genes associated with multiple protein notations were each annotated with the overlapping UniProtKB entries (e.g. OR2A1, OR2A42 were both annotated with the UniProtKB entry for Olfactory receptor 2A1/2A42). To examine the expression level for each gene, we collated the data from both human SCLC samples as well as mouse models of SCLC.5,26 Percentile values for gene expression were determined from each dataset independently. To include a functional output from available in vitro experiment data, we also collected gene dependency scores from the CRISPR knockout screens (Achilles) conducted through the DepMap project.69,70 Cell lines were grouped according to cancer type (SCLC, NSCLC, and all cancers other than SCLC), and the median dependency score was calculated for each gene. AACR GENIE data was obtained from Synapse Platform with written permission.71 For patient samples with multiple alterations (e.g., missense and a frameshift), tally of specific alteration counts in Table S6 was performed by classifying patient samples by the most disruptive to the least disruptive (with fusion/rearrangement events being considered the most disruptive and synonymous mutations the least disruptive), going from the rightmost column to the leftmost column.
52	9972901	BODY48	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'PREPARATION OF TUBA-SEQ SGID-BC AMPLICON LIBRARIES']	CONCLUSIONS	Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor-bearing mouse lungs following the addition of three benchmark control cell lines (1 × 105 cells per control) as previously described.20 Briefly, the lungs were homogenized and lysed with overnight protease K digestion, and genomic DNA was extracted from the lysate using phenol-chloroform and ethanol precipitation methods. Libraries were prepared by single-step PCR amplification of the sgID-BC region from 32 μg of gDNA per mouse split across eight 100 μL reactions with NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix (M0544L). Dual index primer pairs with unique i5 and i7 indices were used. PCR products were purified using Sera-Mag Select beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences 29343052) and assessed for quality with Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies 5067–4626) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies G2939BA). Purified libraries from each mouse were pooled at equal ratios based on lung weight to ensure even sequencing depth per cell, purified once more with Sera-Mag Select beads to remove excess free primers, and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NextSeq 550 platform (Admera Health Biopharma Services).
53	9972901	BODY49	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'TUBA-SEQ ANALYSIS']	CONCLUSIONS	We identified the target gene and random barcodes from the sgID-BC region for each tumor cell as previously described.72 The absolute cell number in each tumor was calculated by normalizing the sgID-BC read number by that of the three benchmark control cell lines. We focused on tumors with at least 200 cells and calculated the LNmean (maximum likelihood estimator for mean tumor size assuming log-normal distribution) and tumor number for tumors carrying each target gene deletion. The LNmean and tumor number were normalized to that of Inert tumors to represent the relative growth advantage after inactivating these genes.

58	6940020	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	Axon-like protrusions promote small cell lung cancer migration and metastasis
59	6940020	ABS0	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	Metastasis is the main cause of death in cancer patients but remains a poorly understood process. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most lethal and most metastatic cancer types. SCLC cells normally express neuroendocrine and neuronal gene programs but accumulating evidence indicates that these cancer cells become relatively more neuronal and less neuroendocrine as they gain the ability to metastasize. Here we show that mouse and human SCLC cells in culture and in vivo can grow cellular protrusions that resemble axons. The formation of these protrusions is controlled by multiple neuronal factors implicated in axonogenesis, axon guidance, and neuroblast migration. Disruption of these axon-like protrusions impairs cell migration in culture and inhibits metastatic ability in vivo. The co-option of developmental neuronal programs is a novel molecular and cellular mechanism that contributes to the high metastatic ability of SCLC.
60	6940020	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Metastases are a major cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. By the time cancer cells leave their primary site and spread to distant sites, they have acquired the ability to migrate and invade, as well as characteristics that enable them to survive and proliferate within new microenvironments. These phenotypes are likely driven by changes in gene expression and epigenetic programs that allow cancer cells to overcome the many hurdles that normally constrain the metastatic process. Despite recent advances, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms underlying metastasis remains incomplete, including how changes in molecular programs can translate into selective advantages that enable cancer cells to spread to other organs (Fidler, 2003; Obenauf and Massagué, 2015; Lambert et al., 2017).
61	6940020	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine cancer that accounts for ~15% of all lung cancers and causes over 200,000 deaths worldwide each year (Sabari et al., 2017). The ability of SCLC cells to leave the primary tumor and establish inoperable metastases is a major cause of death and a serious impediment to successful therapy (van Meerbeeck et al., 2011; Farago and Keane, 2018). SCLC is one of the most metastatic human cancers, with over 60% of SCLC patients presenting with disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis, often including liver, bone, brain, and secondary lung metastases (Nakazawa et al., 2012; Riihimäki et al., 2014).
62	6940020	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Molecular analyses to understand metastatic progression of human cancer are often limited by difficulties in accessing tumor samples at defined stages. This problem is especially true for SCLC, since patients with metastatic disease rarely undergo surgery (Barnes et al., 2017). Genetically engineered mouse models of human SCLC recapitulate the genetics, histology, therapeutic response, and highly metastatic nature of the human disease (Kwon and Berns, 2013; Gazdar et al., 2015; Rudin et al., 2019). These genetically engineered mouse models recapitulate cancer progression in a controlled manner and allow for the isolation of primary tumors and metastases directly from their native microenvironment. Recently, we and others have used mouse models to uncover gene expression programs that are altered in SCLC metastases (Denny et al., 2016; Semenova et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018). While SCLC cells display features of neuroendocrine cells, the gene expression programs in metastatic SCLC include not only genes normally expressed in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells but also those expressed in neurons (Carney et al., 1982; Cutz, 1982; Broers et al., 1987; Anderson et al., 1988). Higher levels of the neuronal markers such as NSE (neuron-specific enolase) correlate with shorter survival and more metastatic disease in SCLC patients (Carney et al., 1982; van Zandwijk et al., 1992; Dong et al., 2019). Broad neuronal gene expression programs are enriched in metastases from mouse models of SCLC, however, whether SCLC cells actually gain neuronal characteristics and whether neuronal features are key regulators of metastatic ability has not been previously characterized (Denny et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018; Böttger et al., 2019).
63	6940020	BODY3	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Here we find that the metastatic state of SCLC can include the growth of protrusions that resemble axons. These axon-like growths increase the ability of SCLC cells to migrate and metastasize, thus representing a cellular mechanism that enhances the metastatic ability of SCLC cells that have transitioned to a more neuronal cell state.
64	6940020	BODY4	['RESULTS', 'SCLC CELLS CAN FORM LONG CELLULAR PROTRUSIONS IN CULTURE AND IN VIVO']	RESULTS	To investigate SCLC migration, we developed an assay in which SCLC cells, which classically grow in culture as floating spheres or aggregates, are grown as a monolayer under Matrigel (Denny et al., 2016 and Materials and methods). Unexpectedly, we noticed that cells from some SCLC cell lines (N2N1G, 16T, 6PF) derived from the Rbf/f;Trp53f/f (DKO) and Rbf/f;Trp53 f/f;p130f/f (TKO) genetically engineered mouse models form long cellular protrusions into cell-free spaces (Figure 1A–B). To determine whether these structures specifically project into cell-free areas or they also exist within monolayers, we cultured a minor fraction of fluorescently-labeled, GFPpositive SCLC cells with control SCLC cells. We found that SCLC cells also form protrusions when they are in close contact with surrounding cancer cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Similar mixing experiments performed in subcutaneous allografts also documented the growth of protrusions by SCLC cells in vivo (Figure 1C–D). Finally, similar structures also extend from SCLC micro-metastases in the liver in the autochthonous TKO mouse model and after intravenous transplantations of SCLC cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C).

68	6940020	BODY8	['RESULTS', 'SCLC CELLS CAN FORM LONG CELLULAR PROTRUSIONS IN CULTURE AND IN VIVO']	RESULTS	Human SCLC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) recapitulate many important features of the human disease (e.g. Saunders et al., 2015; Gardner et al., 2017). To label rare cancer cells within human SCLC PDXs and identify whether they had protrusions in unperturbed tumors, we used DiI tracing. DiI is a lipophilic dye that diffuses within cell membranes and has been widely employed to label projections from individual neurons (Mufson et al., 1990; Heilingoetter and Jensen, 2016). Protrusions from SCLC cells were easily identifiable in two out of three PDX models (Figure 1E–F). Furthermore, human NCI-H446 SCLC cells formed long protrusions into cell-free areas in the 2D culture system (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E) and when grown as xenografts (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). Other human and mouse cells had a variable capacity to form protrusions (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H, Supplementary file 1: Key Resources table, and Supplementary file 2–table 1).
69	6940020	BODY9	['RESULTS', 'SCLC CELLS CAN FORM LONG CELLULAR PROTRUSIONS IN CULTURE AND IN VIVO']	RESULTS	These observations indicated that at least a subset of SCLC cells, which are often described as being ‘small round blue’ cells, can develop long cellular protrusions. We next sought to investigate the nature of these protrusions and uncover their possible role in metastatic SCLC.
70	6940020	BODY10	['RESULTS', 'SCLC PROTRUSIONS RESEMBLE AXONS AND SCLC CELLS WITH PROTRUSIONS MIGRATE SIMILAR TO NEUROBLASTS']	RESULTS	SCLC cells express typical neuroendocrine genes but also neural and neuronal genes (Carney et al., 1982; Cutz, 1982). This observation led us to investigate whether the protrusions were similar to neuronal axons or dendrites. We identified a list of 69 genes classically associated in the scientific literature with axonogenesis and axon guidance, and found that many of these genes are expressed in at least subsets of primary human SCLCs (George et al., 2015) (Supplementary file 2–table 2). Thus, the gene expression programs controlling axonal growth in neuronal cells are also present in SCLC cells. We previously performed gene expression analyses on purified cancer cells from primary tumors and metastases from two mouse models of SCLC (Denny et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018). In these studies, we found a general increase in the expression of neuronal gene expression programs during tumor progression, with broad expression of the selected candidate genes in metastatic SCLCs, indicating that murine SCLC tumors and cell lines derived from these tumors represent a tractable system with which to investigate neuronal programs in SCLC (Supplementary file 2–table 3). Pathway and process enrichment analysis on these 69 genes confirmed their connection with axon guidance, neuron migration, and nervous system development (Supplementary file 2–table 4).
71	6940020	BODY11	['RESULTS', 'SCLC PROTRUSIONS RESEMBLE AXONS AND SCLC CELLS WITH PROTRUSIONS MIGRATE SIMILAR TO NEUROBLASTS']	RESULTS	To further investigate the nature of these SCLC protrusions, we assessed their expression of canonical axonal and dendritic proteins. The protrusions that form from murine and human SCLC cell lines uniformly expressed neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1). More importantly, these protrusions were positive for the axonal marker TAU while expression of the dendritic marker MAP2 was undetectable (Figure 2A–B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C). Tuj1positive, TAUpositive protrusions were also observed in vivo emanating from SCLC cells in the liver of TKO mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). Furthermore, 29/79 (37%) human primary SCLC tumors stained moderately or strongly positive for TAU (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). Most axonogenesis and neuronal migration genes were undetectable in a single-cell RNA-seq analysis of adult lung epithelial cells, which included neuroendocrine cell, further suggesting that these programs are turned on during tumorigenesis (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C) (Ouadah et al., 2019). Immunostaining for the axonal marker GAP43 (which is highly expressed in the metastatic SCLC state; see below) did not uncover any positive normal lung epithelial cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D). Together, these observations indicate that axonal programs are gained during SCLC progression and suggested that the protrusions from SCLC cells are axon-like.

77	6940020	BODY17	['RESULTS', 'SCLC PROTRUSIONS RESEMBLE AXONS AND SCLC CELLS WITH PROTRUSIONS MIGRATE SIMILAR TO NEUROBLASTS']	RESULTS	We quantified the length of protrusions and found that they were often 5 to 10 times longer than the diameter of the cell body (~8 µm) (Figure 2C). The length and the frequency of these axon-like protrusions suggested that they might influence the behavior of SCLC cells. We investigated and quantified the features of SCLC cells with and without protrusions using time-lapse microscopy. Initial observations of mouse SCLC cells showed that the protrusions were very dynamic (Figure 2D and Video 1). In these videos, we noticed that the protrusions resembled cellular processes that have been described in neuroblasts and with the movement of SCLC cells along these protrusions reminiscent of neuronal tangential migration exhibited by neuroblasts (Lois et al., 1996; Oudin et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2015) and interneurons (Leclech et al., 2019). Indeed, when we quantified the movement of SCLC cell along protrusions, SCLC cell lines that form protrusions (16T and N2N1G cell lines) displayed increased saltatory activity compared to SCLC cells that do not form protrusions (KP22 cell line) (Figure 2D–H and Video 2, 3, and 4). The velocity of SCLC cells that form protrusions was also greatly increased compared to cells that do not form protrusions (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).
78	6940020	BODY18	['RESULTS', 'SCLC PROTRUSIONS RESEMBLE AXONS AND SCLC CELLS WITH PROTRUSIONS MIGRATE SIMILAR TO NEUROBLASTS']	RESULTS	Together, these results indicate that SCLC cells can generate axon-like protrusions and that these projections facilitate migration in a manner that is qualitatively similar to neuroblast migration during brain development.
79	6940020	BODY19	['RESULTS', 'EXPRESSION OF A GENE SIGNATURE FOR AXONOGENESIS AND NEURONAL MIGRATION ACROSS SCLC SUBTYPES']	RESULTS	To investigate the functional importance of these axon-like protrusions and their regulation, we focused on 13 genes (out of the 69 genes selected above) that encode for proteins functionally involved in diverse aspects of axon formation, axon guidance, and neuronal migration (Supplementary file 2–table 5). These 13 genes are all expressed in at least a subset of human SCLC tumors (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) (data from George et al., 2015). We excluded gene families for which functional overlap and compensatory mechanism were likely. STRING analysis and literature searches confirmed that these 13 candidates had a significant connection with biological processes related to neurogenesis and the regulation of neuron projection development. These proteins were not often connected with one another and thus likely contribute to distinct aspects of these biological processes (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and Supplementary file 2–table 6).
80	6940020	BODY20	['RESULTS', 'EXPRESSION OF A GENE SIGNATURE FOR AXONOGENESIS AND NEURONAL MIGRATION ACROSS SCLC SUBTYPES']	RESULTS	A better understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the upregulation of gene programs linked to axonogenesis and neuronal migration may help us understand the functional role of these gene programs in SCLC cells. SCLC tumors have been divided in major subtypes driven by key transcription factors (Rudin et al., 2019). In human tumors (George et al., 2015), the 13-gene signature correlated more closely with the ‘SCLC-N’ subtype, driven by the transcription factor NEUROD1, and both human cell line NCI-H446 and the PDX model LU86 (Saunders et al., 2015) belong to this subtype (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). The murine cell lines used to study protrusions in this study are of the ‘SCLC-A’ subtype (driven by the transcription factor ASCL1), even though the correlation between the 13-gene signature and ASCL1 expression was weak in mouse tumors (Yang et al., 2018) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). We also found no correlation between ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression and the ability to grow protrusions in other human cell lines (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and Supplementary file 2–table 1). Thus, the ability to grow protrusions may exist across SCLC subtypes. We and others have identified a role for the NFIB transcription factor in SCLC metastasis and the induction of gene programs linked with neuronal differentiation (Denny et al., 2016; Semenova et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). Notably, the 13-gene signature correlated with high NFIB expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). NFIB knock-down in mouse SCLC cells that had high NFIB levels and formed protrusions did not result in the global downregulation of the 13-gene signature, but was sufficient to reduce the formation of protrusions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F). Overexpression of NFIB in SCLC mouse cells with low NFIB levels and without protrusions was not sufficient to lead to the upregulation of the entire set of 13 genes or to induce the growth of protrusions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E,G). Thus, while NFIB upregulation may be important in the induction of neuronal programs in SCLC cells, the upstream factors that control neuronal programs specifically associated with axonogenesis and migration in SCLC remain to be fully characterized. These experiments led us to more specifically test the role of the 13 selected genes in the formation of protrusions and the role of these protrusions in cell migration and metastasis.
81	6940020	BODY21	['RESULTS', 'LOSS OF AXON-LIKE PROTRUSIONS INHIBITS THE MIGRATION OF SCLC CELLS']	RESULTS	In the 25 human SCLC cell lines analyzed in the Cancer Dependency Map project, knock-down of these 13 genes rarely affected the growth of SCLC cells in culture, consistent with these genes influencing aspects of cell physiology not related to the cell cycle (Supplementary file 2–table 7 and Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). We performed immunostaining for one of these 13 proteins (GAP43) and found that ~50% of human primary SCLC tumors stained moderately or strongly positive (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B), further supporting a role for neuronal programs linked to axonogenesis and migration in SCLC.
82	6940020	BODY22	['RESULTS', 'LOSS OF AXON-LIKE PROTRUSIONS INHIBITS THE MIGRATION OF SCLC CELLS']	RESULTS	The 13-gene signature was overall more highly expressed in N2N1G cells, which are derived from a lymph node metastasis and grow protrusions compared to KP22 cells that do not grow protrusions (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C). We first knocked-down each of these 13 genes with two shRNAs in N2N1G cells. We confirmed stable knock-down by RT-qPCR (Supplementary file 2–table 8) and quantified the development of protrusions in the monolayer culture assay. Knock-down of 11 of the 13 genes significantly reduced the number of protrusions with at least one shRNA (Figure 3A–B and Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). Knock-down of multiple factors normally implicated in distinct steps of axonal growth reduced the development of protrusions from SCLC cells, thus further bolstering the notion that these protrusions are similar to neuronal axons. Knock-down of the many genes involved in axon formation, axonal guidance, and neuronal migration also reduced cell migration (Figure 3B). Quantification of cell migration showed that inhibition of migration correlated with loss of the axon-like protrusions (Figure 3C–D). We validated the knock-down for two of the top candidates, Gap43 and Fez1 genes, by immunoblot for the corresponding proteins in N2N1G cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–C). We further validated the effects of knocking down these two factors on the growth of protrusions and cell migration in a second SCLC cell line (16T; Figure 3E–J and Figure 3—figure supplement 3D–E). Finally, we found that knock-down of Gap43 and Fez1 reduced the ability of SCLC 16T and N2N1G cells to migrate out of 3D spheroids in Matrigel (Figure 3—figure supplement 3F–G).

90	6940020	BODY30	['RESULTS', 'LOSS OF AXON-LIKE PROTRUSIONS INHIBITS THE MIGRATION OF SCLC CELLS']	RESULTS	Together, these data show that SCLC cells with axon-like protrusions migrate in culture similar to what has been described for neuroblasts and that disruption of these protrusions by knocking down a variety of diverse genes involved in axonogenesis and neuronal migration also reduces SCLC migration.
91	6940020	BODY31	['RESULTS', 'KNOCK-DOWN OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMATION OF PROTRUSIONS DECREASES METASTATIC POTENTIAL']	RESULTS	The link between axon-like protrusions and migration in vitro led us to investigate whether these axon-like protrusions promote the metastatic ability of SCLC cells in vivo. In support of this idea, we found that the expression of neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin and TAU was barely detectable in non-metastatic tumors in the lungs of TKO mice 3 months after cancer initiation while a majority of later stage tumors stained strongly positive for both proteins (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B). GAP43 was detectable in 6/9 human SCLC metastases analyzed (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). We also found a significant increase of key genes involved in axonogenesis and neuronal migration in metastases compared to primary tumors in a mouse model of SCLC (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).
92	6940020	BODY32	['RESULTS', 'KNOCK-DOWN OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMATION OF PROTRUSIONS DECREASES METASTATIC POTENTIAL']	RESULTS	To test the role of these protrusions in the metastatic process in vivo, we investigated whether SCLC cells with Gap43 or Fez1 knocked-down had reduced metastatic ability. The products of these genes are thought to regulate axonal development in distinct manners but knock-down of each reduced the formation of protrusions and cell migration in culture. We first assessed whether Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down reduced the metastatic ability of mouse N2N1G SCLC cells after intravenous transplantation of control and knock-down cells into recipient mice. Knock-down of each of these pro-protrusion factors significantly reduced the number of metastases as assessed by tumor counts at the surface of the liver 4–5 weeks after intravenous injection (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B). To determine whether GAP43 and FEZ1 are simply required for tumor growth in vivo, we transplanted Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down cells subcutaneously and quantified tumor growth. Knock-down of these genes had no effect on subcutaneous tumor growth suggesting that the effects on metastatic ability likely represent the disruption of phenotypes uniquely associated with the metastatic process (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). We repeated these experiments with two independent shRNAs for each gene in both N2N1G and 16T SCLC cells, which confirmed that Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down reduced the formation of liver metastases after intravenous injection of SCLC cells (Figure 4A–H and Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–E).

98	6940020	BODY38	['RESULTS', 'KNOCK-DOWN OF GENES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORMATION OF PROTRUSIONS DECREASES METASTATIC POTENTIAL']	RESULTS	The absence of growth defects in subcutaneous tumors following Gap43 and Fez1 knock-down suggested that these genes may affect earlier steps of the metastatic cascade. To test this, we performed similar intravenous transplant experiments but quantified the presence of SCLC cells in the liver 2 days after injection (Figure 4I). Quantification of GFPpositive cancer cells in the liver by flow cytometry documented a significant reduction in metastatic seeding by SCLC cells with Gap43 or Fez1 knocked-down (Figure 4J–M and Figure 4—figure supplement 2F–I). Thus, reduced expression of genes associated with the formation of axon-like protrusions affects early metastatic seeding of SCLC cells in the liver, which ultimately translates to reduced metastatic burden.
99	6940020	BODY39	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	While metastasis remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SCLC patients, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood and no therapeutic strategies exist to prevent metastatic spread or specifically treat metastatic SCLC. Here we investigated the function of neuronal gene expression programs in metastatic SCLC. We found that SCLC cells can grow axon-like protrusions and that these protrusions contribute to the migratory and metastatic phenotypes of these cells. This study identifies a cellular mechanism by which a neuroendocrine-to-neuronal transition promotes metastasis of SCLC cells.
100	6940020	BODY40	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	The expression of neuronal factors in SCLC has been known for more than three decades and has been used as a marker for disease progression (Carney et al., 1982; Cutz, 1982; Broers et al., 1987; Anderson et al., 1988). However, whether neuronal programs in SCLC cells play a direct role in SCLC progression has not been rigorously investigated. We uncovered the formation of axon-like protrusions as one functional aspect of neuronal differentiation in SCLC and provide data to support a role for these protrusions in migration and metastasis. It is likely that other phenotypes usually associated with neurons beyond these axon-like protrusions also contribute to the expansion and the spread of SCLC cells. Furthermore, these axon-like protrusions may have other functions beyond facilitating metastatic seeding to the liver, which may including facilitating SCLC cell migration within the primary tumor, intravasation into the bloodstream, and movement within the parenchyma during metastatic expansion (Shibue et al., 2012). Future investigation of the roles of axon-like protrusions in SCLC will likely benefit from additional genetic analyses as well as high-resolution in vivo imaging methods. Recent evidence suggests that several other human tumor types also increase the expression of neuronal programs as they become more metastatic, especially to the brain (Wingrove et al., 2019). It will be important for future studies to determine if aspects of the neuronal program also contribute to the striking ability of SCLC cells to seed and expand in the brain (Lukas et al., 2017).
101	6940020	BODY41	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Our data indicate that SCLC metastasis is facilitated by the development of axon-like protrusions, however other molecular mechanisms certainly also increase the probability that a cancer cell will successfully overcome all the hurdles that limit the development of tissue destructive metastases. For instance, we found that knock-down of Dcx (coding for Doublecortin) has little to no effect on the number of protrusions but strongly inhibits migration in our 2D Matrigel assay (Figure 3A–B), thus Doublecortin may promote SCLC migration independent from an impact on protrusion formation.
102	6940020	BODY42	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	The formation of protrusions in SCLC cells is controlled by pathways previously implicated in the formation of axons and the migration of neuronal cells but it is unclear how the expression of these pro-protrusion genes is coordinated. Existing data support a role for the NFIB transcription factor across SCLC subtypes in the up-regulation of neuronal gene programs in general and gene programs associated more specifically with axonogenesis and neuronal migration (this study and Denny et al., 2016; Semenova et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016). However, it is likely that a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors contributes to the ability of SCLC to grow protrusions (Qadeer et al., 2019). Adhesion molecules and other factors in the tumor microenvironment are also likely to contribute to the formation of protrusions in vivo (Guo et al., 2000).
103	6940020	BODY43	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Could an understanding of the molecular and cellular processes related to axon-like protrusions in SCLC cells ultimately be translated into clinical benefit for SCLC patients? Because NFIB is an important regulator of neuronal gene programs in SCLC cells, targeting this transcription factor may help inhibit SCLC metastatic potential in the future; one possible strategy could be the use of targeted proteolysis (Paiva and Crews, 2019). Another option could be to target individual factors in the axonogenesis and neuronal migration programs. Several of these factors may be required to drive these programs and these programs may not be as critical for brain function in adults as they are during development. Previous studies on SCLC have targeted the CXCR4 chemokine receptor due to its role in cell adhesion and migration and its expression in SCLC cells (Burger et al., 2003; Teicher, 2014; Taromi et al., 2016). Interestingly, CXCR4 also contributes to the formation of axon-like protrusions (Figure 3). In a recent clinical trial in SCLC patients, CXCR4 inhibition was well tolerated but this inhibition did not significantly reduce disease progression (Salgia et al., 2017). However, agents that reduce the ability of cancer cells to overcome early barriers of metastatic seeding will likely need to be employed in specific settings where inhibition of the metastatic process would logically provide clinical benefit. For example, in patients with resectable SCLC, inhibition of pro-metastatic pathways in the neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant setting could reduce the frequency or multiplicity of metastatic relapse.
104	6940020	BODY44	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	More generally, the transition from a neuroendocrine state to a state where neuroendocrine differentiation is decreased but neuronal differentiation is increased may be related to the exceptional plasticity of SCLC cells (reviewed in Yuan et al., 2019). The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to contribute to migration, metastasis, and resistance to treatment in many cancer contexts and may play a role in SCLC (Singh and Settleman, 2010; Cañadas et al., 2014; Krohn et al., 2014; Allison Stewart et al., 2017; O'Brien-Ball and Biddle, 2017). Vascular mimicry (or epithelial-to-endothelial transition (EET) Yuan et al., 2019) may also contribute to tumor growth and response to treatment in SCLC (Williamson et al., 2016). Similarly, Notch-induced dedifferentiation to a non-neuroendocrine state can generate an intra-tumoral niche that protects neuroendocrine SCLC cells (Lim et al., 2017). Based on our results and recent observations in other cancers (Wingrove et al., 2019), we propose that an epithelial-to-neuronal transition contributes to key aspects of cancer metastasis. Further characterization of this neuronal state in both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cancers is likely to uncover novel mechanisms of cancer progression and may ultimately offer new insight into anti-metastasis strategies in the clinic.
105	6940020	BODY45	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'MOUSE MODEL']	METHODS	All experiments were performed in accordance with Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Trp53flox, Rb1flox, p130flox, and R26mTmG mice have been described (Muzumdar et al., 2007; Schaffer et al., 2010; Denny et al., 2016) (RRID:MMRRC_043692-UCD). Tumors were initiated by inhalation of Adeno-CMV-Cre (University of Iowa Vector Core, Iowa city, Iowa) as described in Denny et al. (2016), following a published protocol (DuPage et al., 2009).
106	6940020	BODY46	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CELL CULTURE']	METHODS	All murine and human SCLC cell lines used in this study grow as floating aggregates and were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS, 1 × GlutaMax, and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Human cell lines were originally purchased from ATCC and cell identities were validated by Genetica DNA Laboratories using STR analysis. NJH29 SCLC cells were derived from a patient-derived xenograft (PDX), which has been described (Jahchan et al., 2013). The LU86 and LU102 models were obtained from Stemcentrx (Saunders et al., 2015). The JHU-LX102 (LX102) model was a kind gift from Dr. Watkins (Leong et al., 2014). The murine cell lines were described (Denny et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018). Briefly, 16T and KP22 cells are from individual primary tumors from the lungs of Rb/p53 DKO mice. N2N1G cells were derived from a lymph node metastasis in an Rb/p53/p130 TKO; Rosa26mTmG mouse. 6PF cells were derived from metastatic cells in the plural fluid in an Rb/p53/p130 TKO; Rosa26mTmG mouse. All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative (MycoAlert Detection Kit, Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).
107	6940020	BODY47	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IN VITRO 2D MATRIGEL MIGRATION AND PROTRUSION ASSAY']	METHODS	Silicone inserts (ibidi 80209, Grafelfing, Germany) were attached to wells in 12-well (up to two inserts) or 24-well (one insert) plates pre-coated with poly-D-lysine for 15 min (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).~8×105 cells were seeded to each chamber of the insert in 100 µL resulting in cells at ~80–90% confluency. After at least 6 hr, the inserts were carefully removed and 0.75–1 mL of a 1:1 Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY): cell culture media mix was slowly added to cover each well. 1 mL of cell culture media was added on top of the solidified Matrigel to prevent drying. For quantification of cell migration and protrusions, the number of cells and the number of protrusions were counted in the gap at 10x under the microscope. The time points (between 36 hr and 96 hr) were dependent on the growth rate of the cell populations.
108	6940020	BODY48	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IN VITRO EMIGRATION ASSAY']	METHODS	1:1 Matrigel (Corning, Corning, NY):cell culture media mix containing SCLC spheres were added to Corning 12-well plates. The plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 hr. Images were obtained using a Keyence BZ-X710 microscope at 10X. Image analysis was carried out using ImageJ by measuring the area covered by cells that migrated out the aggregates/spheres. nine spheres in total were analyzed per condition in two independent experiments and the emigration efficiency was calculated by normalizing the area of emigration to the area of each sphere analyzed.
109	6940020	BODY49	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'LIVE IMAGING OF CELL MIGRATION AND QUANTIFICATION']	METHODS	SCLC cells were plated as described in the 2D Matrigel migration assay and cultured for 24 hr before imaging. Then 10x DIC images were collected every 15 min for 25 hr using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with a live imaging chamber set to 37°C, 5% CO2. To quantify the time-lapse videos, we examined nuclear movement and process length (as described in Oudin et al., 2011) using the FIJI software (NIH, Bethesda, USA). The position of the cell nucleus was tracked in each frame using the Manual Tracking plugin to obtain the distance migrated by the nucleus per frame and the average cell velocity over the entire video. Neuronal cell migration occurs via three steps: the cell extends a leading process, the nucleus translocates into the leading process via nucleokinesis, and the cell loses its trailing process. To quantify translocation events, we quantified the fractions of steps taken by each cell that were over 8 µm, which represents the length of one cell body and a nuclear translocation event. The process length was calculated by tracing a line from the cell body to the tip of the leading process about 6 hr into the video. Over 30 cells were tracked and analyzed per condition.
110	6940020	BODY50	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IMMUNOSTAINING OF CELLS IN CULTURE AND HUMAN AND MOUSE TISSUES']	METHODS	Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton and stained for Tuj1 (BioLegend 801213, San Diego, CA, RRID:AB_2728521), TAU (Dako A0024, Santa Clara, CA, RRID:AB_10013724), and MAP2 (1:500, EMD Millipore AB5622, Burlington, MA, RRID:AB_91939), and with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Cat # A32733, Waltham, MA, RRID:AB_2633282). Membrane GFP was stained (Abcam ab13970, Cambridge, UK, RRID:AB_300798) to mark SCLC cells and the expression of the other neuronal markers were checked using a fluorescence scope (Zeiss LSM 880). Staining was quantified by counting directly under the microscope (at 40x magnification).
111	6940020	BODY51	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IMMUNOSTAINING OF CELLS IN CULTURE AND HUMAN AND MOUSE TISSUES']	METHODS	For immunofluorescence, mouse brain and lungs were fixed in 4% PFA and embedded in paraffin. Tissues were stained for GAP43 (Abcam ab16053, Cambridge, UK, RRID:AB_443303) or CGRP (Sigma C7113, Darmstadt, Germany, RRID:AB_259000) to label neuroendocrine cells. For immunohistochemistry, mouse tumor samples were fixed in 4% formalin and paraffin embedded. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H and E) staining was performed using standard methods. For immunohistochemistry, we used antibodies to GFP (Abcam ab6673, RRID:AB_305643), UCHL1 (Sigma-Aldrich HPA005993, RRID:AB_1858560), Tuj1 (BioLegend 801213, RRID:AB_2728521), and TAU (Dako A0024, RRID:AB_10013724).
112	6940020	BODY52	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IMMUNOSTAINING OF CELLS IN CULTURE AND HUMAN AND MOUSE TISSUES']	METHODS	Tissue microarrays (LC818a, US Biomax, Rockville, MD) were stained for TAU and scored by a board-certified pathologist on a three point scale as follows: 0 = negative or weak staining of less than 10% cells, 1 = moderate intensity staining, 2 = strong intensity staining.
113	6940020	BODY53	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'WHOLE MOUNT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STAINING AND IMAGING OF TUMORS']	METHODS	Detailed methods for whole mount immunofluorescence staining have been described (Yang et al., 2018). Subcutaneous tumors with 5–10% GFPpositive cells mixed with non-GFP labeled SCLC tumor cells were dissected and were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and sectioned with a vibrating blade microtome at 500 μm thickness. Tumor slices were optically cleared using the CUBIC method, comprised of a three-hour incubation at room temperature in CUBIC one reagent and long-term storage in CUBIC 2 at 4°C (Susaki et al., 2015). Sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 780 laser scanning confocal microscope.
114	6940020	BODY54	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'WHOLE MOUNT IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE STAINING AND IMAGING OF TUMORS']	METHODS	For DiI staining and imaging, subcutaneously transplanted human SCLC xenograft were harvested after 3 weeks of growth and cut into 500mm ~ 1 cm thick slices. Tumor pieces were stained with the red fluorescent tracer DiI (D282, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a spot-wise manner, incubated in 37°C, 5% CO2 chamber for 20 min and washed three times with PBS+10%FBS to remove excess DiI before imaging. Images were collected using a Leica SP5 scope (Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL) with a water immersion lens.
115	6940020	BODY55	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CANDIDATE GENE KNOCKDOWN']	METHODS	Stable knockdown of candidate genes was performed using lentiviral pLKO vectors and puromycin-resistance selection (Sigma-Aldrich). For lentivirus production, 7.5 × 106 HEK293T cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes and transfected with the vector of interest using PEI (Polysciences 23966–2, Warrington, PA) along with pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene #8454) envelope plasmid and pCMV-dR8.2 dvpr (Addgene #8455) packaging plasmid. The medium was changed 24 hr later. Supernatants were collected at 36 hr and 48 hr, passed through a 40 μm filter and applied at full concentration to target cells. Two days after transduction cells were selected with Puromycin (2 μg/mL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for at least 1 week. Knockdown was confirmed by RT-qPCR as in Denny et al. (2016) and immunoblot analysis. NFIB knock-down and its validation is described in Denny et al. (2016). Table S8 shows the sequences of the oligonucleotides used to knock down the candidate genes. Note that the expression of the shRNAs targeting GFP partially decreased GFP expression, but cancer cells were still GFPpositive and could be detected by flow cytometry and microscopy.
116	6940020	BODY56	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IMMUNOBLOT ANALYSIS']	METHODS	GAP43 (Abcam ab16053, Cambridge, UK, RRID:AB_443303), FEZ1 (Cell Signaling 42480, Danvers, MA, RRID:AB_2799222), and HSP90 (BD Transduction Laboratories 610418, San Jose, CA, RRID:AB_397798) antibodies were used to confirm the knockdown of each gene at the protein level. Briefly, denatured protein samples were run on 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (NuPage, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and transferred onto PVDF membrane. Primary antibody incubations were followed by secondary HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-2005, Santa Cruz, CA, RRID:AB_631736) and anti-rabbit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-2030, Santa Cruz, CA, RRID:AB_631747) antibodies and membranes were developed with the ECL2 Western Blotting Substrate (Pierce Protein Biology, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
117	6940020	BODY57	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'TRANSPLANTATION ASSAYS']	METHODS	For long-term metastasis assays, 3 × 104 of N2N1G cells or 1 × 105 of 16 T cells were injected intravenously injected into the lateral tail vein of NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME - Stock number 005557, RRID:IMSR_JAX:005557). Mouse livers were harvested at 4–6 weeks after injection. Tumor number was quantified by directly counting on liver surface and also quantified by counting metastasis number or areas on the H and E sections. For subcutaneous injection, 5 × 104 cells were resuspended in 100 μL PBS and mixed with 100 µL Matrigel (Corning, 356231, Corning, NY) with four injection sites per mouse. For both subcutaneous and intravenous injections, SCLC cells were transplanted into age-matched gender-matched NSG mice. For short-term tumor seeding assays, 2 × 107 of N2N1G cells or 5 × 107 of 16 T cells were transplanted intravenously into the lateral tail vein of NSG mice. N2N1G, derived from Rb/p53/p130 TKO; Rosa26mTmG mouse, has endogenous GFP expression and 16T, derived from Rb/p53 TKO mouse, was stained by live cell stain CFSE (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34554) and washed prior to intravenous injection. 2 days after transplantation, mouse livers were harvested, dissociated into a single cell suspension and analyzed by FACS to determine the percentage of GFPpositive cancer cells. FACS data were analyzed by FlowJo.
118	6940020	BODY58	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'SINGLE-CELL RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Single-cell sequencing data from normal pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and other major airway epithelial cell types previously annotated (Ouadah et al., 2019) were analyzed for expression of a curated list of genes. The methods for measuring expressing of each gene in transcripts per million (tpm) are previously described (Ouadah et al., 2019). In this report, we imported the tpm (JO_tpmGenes_noERCCs.txt) into Seurat v2.0 to create a seurat object and normalized using standardized methods previously described (Butler et al., 2018). Gene expression data were represented using heatmaps.
119	6940020	BODY59	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'PATHWAY AND PROCESS ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Metascape (metascape.org, RRID:SCR_016620) was used to analyze the lists of genes involved in axonogenesis and neuronal migration. Metascape integrates data from KEGG Pathway, GO Biological Processes, Reactome Gene Sets, Canonical Pathways and CORUM (Zhou et al., 2019). The analysis of interactions between the top 13 candidate genes was performed using STRING (string-db.org) (Szklarczyk et al., 2019). The analysis of dependency upon knock-down was performed using the in the Cancer Dependency Map project (depmap.org/portal/) in February 2019 with the Combined RNAi (Broad, Novartis, Marcotte) data (Tsherniak et al., 2017). The human RNA-seq datasets for human SCLC are from George et al. (2015). Data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) are available at the Expression Atlas (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home). The complete RNA-seq analysis of KP22 and N2N1G mouse cells will be published elsewhere, but the data are available in Supplementary file 2–table 9. The mouse primary tumors and metastases datasets are from Denny et al. (2016); Yang et al. (2018).
120	6940020	BODY60	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'STATISTICS']	METHODS	Statistical significance was assayed with GraphPad Prism software (RRID:SCR_002798). The statistical tests used, the numerical p-values, and the number of independent replicates is indicated in the figure legends.
121	6141466	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	Recurrent WNT pathway alterations are frequent in relapsed small cell lung cancer
122	6141466	ABS0	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	Nearly all patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) eventually relapse with chemoresistant disease. The molecular mechanisms driving chemoresistance in SCLC remain un-characterized. Here, we describe whole-exome sequencing of paired SCLC tumor samples procured at diagnosis and relapse from 12 patients, and unpaired relapse samples from 18 additional patients. Multiple somatic copy number alterations, including gains in ABCC1 and deletions in MYCL, MSH2, and MSH6, are identifiable in relapsed samples. Relapse samples also exhibit recurrent mutations and loss of heterozygosity in regulators of WNT signaling, including CHD8 and APC. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data shows enrichment for an ASCL1-low expression subtype and WNT activation in relapse samples. Activation of WNT signaling in chemosensitive human SCLC cell lines through APC knockdown induces chemoresistance. Additionally, in vitro-derived chemoresistant cell lines demonstrate increased WNT activity. Overall, our results suggest WNT signaling activation as a mechanism of chemoresistance in relapsed SCLC.
123	6141466	ABS1	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients frequently relapse and become resistant to chemotherapy. Here, the authors analyse the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of primary and relapsed SCLC patients as well as in vitro models, and discover that activation of WNT signalling can drive chemotherapy resistance.
124	6141466	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Nearly 13% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)1. SCLC is a highly aggressive malignancy that is characterized by a short doubling time and tendency to metastasize early. Although patients with newly diagnosed SCLC often achieve dramatic responses to initial treatment with platinum doublet chemotherapy, most patients relapse with rapidly worsening disease that is resistant to further treatment. The median survival in patients with SCLC is ~7 months, and this has not substantially changed in the past few decades—owing to the lack of effective treatment options for patients with relapsed disease2. Therefore, understanding the molecular basis of treatment resistance and identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities is necessary to improve outcomes in patients with relapsed SCLC.
125	6141466	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	SCLC is characterized by a variety of genomic alterations and relatively higher mutation rate per megabase (Mb) compared to many other malignancies3,4, and is associated with heavy tobacco smoking. Comprehensive genomic analyses of human SCLC have shown inactivation of the tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 to be a characteristic feature of this disease3. SCLC is a high grade neuroendocrine tumor, and differentiation in SCLC is driven predominantly by the lineage factors ASCL1 and NEUROD1, which play a crucial role in cell survival5,6. Although subtyping SCLCs based on the lineage survival factor they overexpress is not performed in the clinical setting, ASCL1 and NEURDO1 predominant SCLCs are characterized by significant differences in their genetic and epigenetic profiles. In addition to these alterations, SCLCs also show alterations in pathways that regulate neuroendocrine differentiation (such as NOTCH signaling) and amplifications in oncogenes such as SOX2, MYC, MYCL, and MYCN. While the genomic landscape of treatment-naive SCLC has been well described by different groups, very few samples profiled to date have been obtained from patients with relapsed disease in these studies3,7–9. Therefore, the genomic landscape of relapsed SCLC and the molecular mechanisms that drive chemotherapy resistance in this disease continue to remain poorly defined.
126	6141466	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	The primary objective of our study is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotherapy resistance in patients with relapsed SCLC, as a means to circumvent traditional chemotherapy resistance with novel therapeutic approaches. To this end, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of SCLC tumor samples obtained from 30 patients following relapse (relapse samples). Representative slides from these samples were reviewed and confirmed to be SCLC by two pathologists independently (Supplementary tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Data). Corresponding chemotherapy-naive tumor samples were available for 12 patients (treatment-naive samples). Additionally, we performed tumor RNA-sequencing of samples obtained at relapse from 18 of the 30 patients. Here we highlight the key similarities and differences in the genomic landscape of primary and relapsed SCLCs. We also demonstrate how integrative analysis of RNA and DNA sequencing data from these tumors identify activation of canonical WNT signaling as a likely mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in SCLCs.
127	6141466	BODY3	['RESULTS', 'THE MUTATIONAL LANDSCAPE OF RELAPSED SCLCS']	RESULTS	Consistent with previously published studies, the total tumor mutation burden (TMB) of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) was high for both chemotherapy-naive and relapsed samples, due to the strong association between heavy cigarette smoking and SCLC tumorigenesis3,4,8,9. TMB was not significantly different between treatment-naive and relapsed SCLC samples (8.31/Mb [range: 1.50–16.87] vs. 8.37/Mb [range: 1.38–14.04]; p = 0.93, unpaired t- test). As expected, a single tumor sample obtained from a never-smoker (SCLC17), demonstrated a much lower mutational burden (1.40/Mb in chemotherapy-naive and 1.50/Mb in relapsed samples, respectively). Tumor samples obtained from all patients with a history of smoking were enriched for C > A||G > T transversions, and the samples from SCLC17 contained a lower proportion of C > A transversions. A comparison of the mutation patterns between relapse and treatment-naive samples by deconstructSigs10 failed to show an enrichment for the pancreatic platinum-response-associated mutation signature in relapse samples (signature 3, Supplementary fig. 1), possibly owing to the similarity in context between smoking and platinum-associated mutation signatures11, and to the overwhelming proportion of smoking-associated mutations across our samples. Consistent with previous observations made from genomes of irradiated tumors, relapse SCLC samples obtained from patients with limited stage SCLC who were treated with radiation (N = 14) were enriched for indels when compared to samples that were not irradiated (N = 16; p = 3.67e−13, unpaired t- test)12. For two individuals, metastatic sites were sectioned and sequenced, indicating little spatial heterogeneity in mutations within a metastatic site; however, distinct subsets of mutations were identified in samples collected from different metastatic sites within the same patient (Supplementary fig. 2).
128	6141466	BODY4	['RESULTS', 'THE MUTATIONAL LANDSCAPE OF RELAPSED SCLCS']	RESULTS	We observed TP53 and RB1 mutations in the majority of treatment-naive (TP53 in 11 of 12, RB1 in 10 of 12 patients) and relapse samples (TP53 in 29 of 30, RB1 in 21 of 30 patients). Loss of heterozygosity (LoH) of TP53 was observed in the one sample lacking a detectable TP53 mutation, and RB1 LoH was observed in seven of nine samples where no RB1 mutations were detected. These results are concordant with previous findings that RB1 is likely altered by intronic, epigenetic or large structural rearrangements that are not identifiable by WES in the remaining two treatment-naive samples. Together, 100% and 93% of relapse SCLC samples showed a mutation or LoH in TP53 and RB1 respectively, indicating that alterations in these genes are a characteristic feature of relapsed disease, similar to prior observations of their prevalence in primary SCLCs3. Including TP53 and RB1, a total of 30 genes were mutated at a statistically significant level using MuSiC13 (FDR CT, Q < 0.1) when evaluating only relapse SCLC samples (Fig. 1)13,14. COL11A1 (Q = 8.06e−07, Supplementary table 3), which codes for the alpha I chain of type XI collagen, was the most significantly mutated gene (SMG) after TP53 and RB1. COL11A1 is an important component of the extracellular matrix and its dysregulation has been shown to mediate resistance to platinum chemotherapy15.Fig. 1Significantly mutated genes in relapsed SCLC. Mutation burdens (mutations/mega-base pair) are displayed on the x-axis panel (top), and cohort mutation percentage by gene is displayed on the y-axis panel (left).

130	6141466	BODY6	['RESULTS', 'THE MUTATIONAL LANDSCAPE OF RELAPSED SCLCS']	RESULTS	We also observed multiple recurrent somatic copy number alterations in relapsed SCLCs by GISTIC analysis (Q < 0.1) (Supplementary table 4)16, some of which are likely to play a crucial role in mediating chemotherapy resistance. Among these was ABCC1 (N = 7), also known as MRP1 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1), an ATP-binding cassette membrane protein that transports physiologic substrates and drugs out of the cytoplasm17. ABCC1 mRNA was first isolated from a multi-drug resistant SCLC cell line (H69-AR), where it is upregulated through amplification18. We also observed deletions in mismatch repair (MMR) genes MSH2 (N = 5) and MSH6 (N = 5) at a significant level in relapse samples. Treatment-naive samples in our analysis did not show either of these copy number alterations at a significant level. Additionally, MSH6 mutations were observed only in relapse SCLC samples (N = 3), and none of the treatment-naive samples in our cohort. These observations are concordant with previously reported associations between MMR deficiency and cisplatin resistance in ovarian and colon cancer cell lines19.
131	6141466	BODY7	['RESULTS', 'THE MUTATIONAL LANDSCAPE OF RELAPSED SCLCS']	RESULTS	In addition to our relapsed mutational landscape analysis, we also compared non-synonymous mutation data between patient matched treatment-naive and relapsed sample pairs to identify relapse-acquired mutations. The high background mutation rate of SCLC and limited number of patient-matched paired samples, however, restricted our ability to statistically identify relapse-acquired mutations of interest. We therefore adopted a knowledge-based approach to identify genes of interest. We observed a total of 938 relapse-acquired mutations in 882 genes across the twelve paired samples. From these 882 genes, 603 were altered in relapse samples and none of the treatment-naive samples (Supplementary table 5). We then stringently filtered our list of 603 genes to only include genes with a known or predicted role in cancer. For this purpose, we utilized a list of 114 genes that were mutated at a statistically significant level across 21 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer analysis (Supplementary table 6)20. Our filtering resulted in the nomination of seven genes—CHD8, APC, DDX3X, MBD1, RHOA, RUNX1, and SMARCA4 as candidates for further analysis. Among these, recurrent mutations were observed in CHD8 (N = 6 of 30 patients), APC (N = 4), MBD1 (N = 3), and DDX3X (N = 2).
132	6141466	BODY8	['RESULTS', 'CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE AND NON-NEUROENDOCRINE DIFFERENTIATION']	RESULTS	Due to the striking similarity of the mutational landscape of primary and relapsed SCLCs, we investigated the role of transcriptional changes that may account for acquired chemotherapy resistance. SCLC is a neuroendocrine malignancy with demonstrated dysregulation of neuroendocrine lineage survival factors such as ASCL1 and NEUROD15,6. Previous studies of treatment-naive SCLC samples indicated that the majority of these tumors belong to a subtype that overexpresses ASCL1. ASCL1-high cell lines and murine tumors are typically enriched for MYCL amplifications or overexpression5,6. Contrary to what has been observed in treatment-naive SCLCs, we observed deletions encompassing MYCL (N = 4) at a statistically significant level in relapsed SCLC samples (Q < 0.1; Supplementary table 4). Additionally, RNA-sequencing data showed a higher than expected proportion6 of ASCL1-low tumors (50% vs. 18%; p = 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) in our cohort of relapsed SCLC samples (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2Relapsed human SCLC samples are enriched for ASCL1-low subtype and show a higher level of WNT activity. a Categorization of relapsed SCLC into ASCL1-high (left), NEUROD1-high (right), and ASCL1 and NEUROD1-low (dual negative; center) expression sub-types.

134	6141466	BODY10	['RESULTS', 'CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE AND NON-NEUROENDOCRINE DIFFERENTIATION']	RESULTS	We utilized previously published RNA-sequencing data from 80 treatment-naive SCLC samples3 to compare their expression profiles to our relapse SCLC samples using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) method21. Acknowledging the caveat that any observed differences could be due to a combination of true biological differences and batch effects across studies, we compared ASCL1-driven gene expression (defined by Borromeo et al.5) enrichment scores between the 80 treatment-naive and 18 relapsed SCLC samples. This showed significantly lower ssGSEA scores for ASCL1-driven gene expression among relapse samples (p < 0.05, unpaired t- test) (Fig. 2b).
135	6141466	BODY11	['RESULTS', 'CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE AND NON-NEUROENDOCRINE DIFFERENTIATION']	RESULTS	To test this at the protein level, we obtained an independent set of 12 pre-treatment and 10 post-treatment human SCLC samples from patients who received standard platinum chemotherapy. Immunohistochemistry for ASCL1 revealed a significant reduction in ASCL1-positive (ASCL1+) samples post-treatment (from 6 of 12 ASCL1+ pre-treatment to 0 of 10 ASCL1+ post treatment, p = 0.0152, Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 3a, b). Consistent with these data, both MYCL and ASCL1 were downregulated in two independent matched pairs of chemotherapy sensitive and resistant human SCLC cell lines (Fig. 3c). Collectively, these findings suggest a link between non-neuroendocrine differentiation and chemotherapy resistance in SCLCs. This hypothesis is concordant with in vitro data from other studies that have shown an association between non-neuroendocrine differentiation and chemotherapy resistance in SCLC22,23.Fig. 3ASCL1 and MYCL are downregulated in post-chemotherapy human SCLC tissue and chemotherapy resistant cell lines. a Contingency table with number of chemotherapy naive (pre) and post-chemotherapy (post) SCLC human samples stained with antibodies to ASCL1. b Representative IHC for ASCL1 positive staining (brown) and negative staining (blue).

137	6141466	BODY13	['RESULTS', 'WNT SIGNALING AND CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE IN SCLC']	RESULTS	Based on our observations that markers of non-neuroendocrine differentiation are linked to chemotherapy resistance, we hypothesized that chemotherapy resistance would be driven by one or more modulators of cellular differentiation. Evaluating our previously identified relapse-acquired genes, we observed that mutations in APC and CHD8 were both mutually exclusive and present in nearly one third of relapse SCLC samples (N = 4, 6, respectively; Supplementary fig. 3). APC, which is mutated in several cancers, is a well-established negative regulator of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and WNT signaling24. Similarly, CHD8 inhibits CTNNB1-mediated transcription in the nucleus and is recurrently mutated in prostate and gastric cancers25–28. Due to the role of WNT signaling in cellular differentiation and in driving treatment resistance in other cancers, we hypothesized that this pathway may play an important role in the acquisition of chemotherapy resistance in relapsed SCLC29–33. To evaluate this, we examined our data for mutations in other genes of the CTNNB1-mediated (canonical) WNT signaling pathway (Online Methods; Supplementary table 7). This analysis revealed relapse-acquired mutations in additional genes regulating canonical WNT signaling such as CSNK1A1, HECW1, KMT2D, TLE2, TLE3, WNT1, and YWHAZ (Supplementary fig. 3). Overall, relapse SCLC samples from 24 of 30 patients (80%) contained non-synonymous mutations in genes belonging to canonical WNT signaling that were unaltered in treatment-naive samples, with 6 of 12 (50%) paired samples exhibiting at least one relapse-acquired non-synonymous mutation in this pathway. We also observed highly recurrent LoH in the WNT signaling genes APC (N = 19; 63% of cohort), CSNK1A1 (N = 20; 67%), and PSMD6 (N = 25; 83%). Based upon these observations, we hypothesized that the level of canonical WNT pathway activation would be significantly higher among relapsed SCLC samples when compared to treatment-naive samples. We found that WNT pathway activation (as defined by gene expression signatures from two independent studies34,35) showed significantly higher ssGSEA enrichment scores for canonical WNT pathway activity in relapse SCLC samples compared to primary, treatment-naive samples (p < 0.0001 for each signature, unpaired t- test; Fig. 2c, d).
138	6141466	BODY14	['RESULTS', 'WNT SIGNALING AND CHEMOTHERAPY RESISTANCE IN SCLC']	RESULTS	We then performed in vitro analyses to test the hypothesis that WNT activation drives chemotherapy resistance in SCLC by using APC knockdown as a model for WNT activation. Stable APC knockdown through lentiviral delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the NCI-H1694 cell line (chemotherapy sensitive with wildtype APC), led to the activation of canonical WNT signaling and made these cells highly resistant to etoposide (Fig. 4a–c) and—to a lesser degree—cisplatin (Supplementary fig. 4a, b). Additionally, these cells could be re-sensitized to chemotherapy following overexpression of a wildtype APC construct lacking untranslated regions (UTRs), in cells stably transfected with a knockdown shRNA construct targeting the 3′ UTR (construct shAPC#2; Fig. 4c and Supplementary fig. 4c). We were also able to induce etoposide resistance and activation of WNT signaling through CRISPR–Cas9-guided deletion of APC in a different SCLC cell line, H82 (NCI-H82) (Fig. 4d–f). The extent to which these cells became etoposide resistant was modest in comparison to H1694 cells with APC knockdown, with a 4.3-fold increase in IC50 (Fig. 4f). Next, to determine the role of APC and WNT signaling in the setting of acquired chemotherapy resistance in vitro, we measured WNT activity in human SCLC cell lines DMS53 and NCI-H1048 and their chemotherapy resistant variants derived in culture. Chemotherapy resistant variants of both cell lines showed evidence of increased WNT activity when compared to their chemotherapy sensitive counterparts based on increased levels of CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF (TOPFlash) WNT reporter activity (Supplementary fig. 5). Furthermore, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of global transcriptomic changes in these matched chemotherapy-sensitive and resistant pairs identified CTNNB1 as a top predicted upstream regulator in resistant samples (p = 2.35e−23 and 2.45e−18 for DMS53 and NCI-H1048, respectively, right-tailed Fisher’s exact test).Fig. 4Loss of APC induces chemotherapy resistance in human SCLC cell lines. a Left: knockdown of APC in H1694 cells with two different shAPC constructs (shAPC#1 and shAPC#2); right: activation of WNT signaling as measured by AXIN2 upregulation and TOPFlash reporter activity (signal fold changes) in these cells.

140	6141466	BODY16	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Results from our study suggest that activation of canonical WNT signaling leads to chemotherapy resistance in SCLC—a finding that has not been previously reported to the best of our knowledge. WNT activation is likely to drive treatment resistance through its effects on apoptosis, DNA repair, expression of drug efflux pumps, cell differentiation, and/or by facilitating immune evasion30,31,36,37. We noted alterations in multiple genes that participate in WNT signaling among relapsed tumors, independent of the presence of APC or CHD8 alterations. Similar findings were reported for colorectal cancer by The Cancer Genome Atlas, where tumors harboring APC mutations were also found to harbor other WNT pathway alterations38. While the biological significance of cancer cells acquiring multiple alterations in the same pathway is unclear and may seem counterintuitive, it is possible that tumor cells select for these alterations to achieve an optimal level of WNT signaling39. On the other hand, these alterations could be confined to different subclones within the tumor and represent various mechanisms through which cancer cells activate WNT signaling. We also observed LoH in negative regulators of canonical WNT signaling such as APC and CSNK1A1 in nearly two-thirds of relapse SCLC samples. In conjunction with the high ssGSEA scores for WNT activation among relapse samples, this observation demonstrates that WNT signaling genes are likely to be altered through mechanisms other than non-synonymous mutations, which WES alone is unable to detect. Furthermore, components of the WNT signaling pathway are promiscuous in their interactions and demonstrate a great degree of overlap with other pathways. Therefore, molecular studies of how alterations in WNT signaling affect the net activation of different pathways and a comprehensive analysis of the clonal architecture of tumors employing ultra-deep or single-cell sequencing techniques is likely to shed more light on the precise mechanisms of drug resistance in SCLC.
141	6141466	BODY17	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	A recent study reported by Gardner et al. utilizing human SCLC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) failed to observe mutational differences between treatment-naive and relapsed SCLCs40. EZH2-mediated epigenetic reprogramming that led to the silencing of SLFN11 was identified as the mechanism driving induced chemotherapy resistance in this study—a finding which we were unable to reproduce, possibly due to a lack of paired primary-relapse gene expression data. Interestingly, another recent analysis by Drapkin et al., reported an association between increased expression of a MYC gene signature and chemotherapy resistance in SCLC PDXs derived from biopsy samples and circulating tumor cells, but failed to observe a correlation between SLFN11 expression and chemotherapy sensitivity41. Heterogeneity in mechanisms that drive chemotherapy resistance in SCLC, sample characteristics, and differences in experimental design are likely factors contributing to the observed discrepancies between studies. For instance, since chemotherapy is known to affect immunogenic cell death in cancer cells and WNT signaling plays an important role in shaping tumor-host immune interactions, the utilization of immunodeficient mice for generating PDXs could have influenced the selection pressures acting on grafted tumors following exposure to chemotherapy in these studies31,42.
142	6141466	BODY18	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of paired human SCLC samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse. We acknowledge the limitations of our study, particularly with regard to small sample size, limited number of matched treatment-naive samples, and lack of RNA-sequencing data from treatment-naive samples. While these factors limit our ability to perform a number of additional informative analyses (e.g., tumor/relapse paired CTNNB1 immunohistochemistry), it is extremely important to consider that patients with relapsed SCLC rarely undergo biopsies that yield enough tissue for high throughput sequencing. Our ability to demonstrate WNT pathway mutations and activation in relapse SCLC samples, and to validate their role in mediating chemotherapy resistance in vitro provide a rationale for studying WNT signaling inhibitors to overcome treatment resistance in SCLC.
143	6141466	BODY19	['METHODS', 'PRIMARY COHORT SAMPLE ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING']	METHODS	Tumor specimens for whole exome and transcriptome sequencing were obtained from patients diagnosed with SCLC who were treated at the Alvin J Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine. The Human Research Protection Office (HRPO) at the Washington University School of Medicine approved the study. All patients provided informed consent for participation and underwent a biopsy at the time of relapse and pre-treatment biopsy specimens were obtained for the twelve patients for whom a corresponding primary was available. Pathological diagnosis was confirmed by independent review by two pathologists (authors CJO and JHR; images available as Supplementary Data). Tumor specimens from multiple metastatic sites at relapse were available for two patients. For these patients, we also identified a single representative sample based upon observed VAFs for called mutations among all specimens from that patient. These representative samples were used in cohort-level analyses to maintain biological independence among tested samples in the cohort. Peripheral blood was used for germline analysis for all patients. Tissues were assigned a code and banked. Patient consenting, sample and data collection and storage were all conducted in compliance with institutional ethical regulations.
144	6141466	BODY20	['METHODS', 'PRIMARY COHORT SAMPLE ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING']	METHODS	DNA and RNA extractions were performed using Qiagen kits. The DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit was used for DNA isolation from flash frozen (FF) materials. The QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue or QIAamp DNA Mini kit was used for DNA isolation from FFPE materials. The RNeasy Mini kit was used for RNA isolation from FF materials.
145	6141466	BODY21	['METHODS', 'PRIMARY COHORT SAMPLE ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING']	METHODS	Specimens were prepared in several batches (work orders) over the course of the study. Reference Supplementary Tables Sample Work Orders (Supplementary table 8) and Work Order Details (Supplementary table 9) for kits used for library construction and capture methods applied to each sample. Specimens were pooled together pre-capture, 400 ng/sample for a 1.6 μg input for capture. Each pool was sequenced over two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq sequencing instrument.
146	6141466	BODY22	['METHODS', 'GENOME ALIGNMENT AND VARIANT CALLING']	METHODS	All genomic analyses were managed with the Genome Modeling System (GMS)43. Exome sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome build GRCh37 using bwamem version 0.7.10 with default parameters44. Exome alignment models were processed by the GMS Somatic variation pipeline to identify single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (indels), and copy number alterations (CNAs)43. The union of snv/indel variant calls for each sample were manually reviewed using IGV45 (Supplementary table 10). Somatic SNV detection was performed in this pipeline using a combination of SomaticSniper (version 1.0.2)46, VarScan (version 2.3.6)47, and Strelka (1.0.11)48. Somatic small indels were detected by a combination of GATK Somatic Indel Detector (version 5336)49, Pindel (version 0.5)50, VarScan, and Strelka. Annotation of variants was performed using the GMS transcript variant annotator against a GMS “annotation” build based on Ensembl v74_37 transcripts. SNVs and INDELs were further filtered by removing artifacts found in a panel of 905 normal exomes51, removing sites that exceeded 0.1% frequency in the ExAC cohort release v0.252, and then using a bayesian classifier (https://github.com/genome/genome/blob/master/lib/perl/Genome/Model/Tools/Validation/IdentifyOutliers.pm) and retaining variants classified as somatic with a binomial log-likelihood of at least 10 (params: -llr-cutoff 10). Finally, these filtered mutations then underwent manual review with IGV.
147	6141466	BODY23	['METHODS', 'TUMOR HETEROGENEITY']	METHODS	Variant allele frequencies were analyzed using SciClone 1.0.7 to visualize clonality53. Variants were visualized and compared with an ad hoc R script, available on the paper methods repository for this manuscript (https://github.com/ahwagner/sclc).
148	6141466	BODY24	['METHODS', 'MUTATION SIGNATURES']	METHODS	Mutation signatures were calculated using the deconstructSigs R package10. The signatures evaluated were the 30 COSMIC signatures for mutational processes in human cancers (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures). A difference of indel counts between limited and extensive stage samples (Supplementary table 1) was tested by unpaired t- test.
149	6141466	BODY25	['METHODS', 'SIGNIFICANTLY MUTATED GENES']	METHODS	SMGs in relapsed samples were identified using MuSiC v0.413. The region of interest file was created using regions annotated as CDS or RNA in Ensembl v74 with 2 bp flank added to contiguous exons in order to retain splice sites. Only relapse and normal samples were used for analysis. For individuals with multiple relapse samples, variants from all relapse samples for that individual were merged, deduplicated and used for analysis. A representative BAM file was also used for coverage calculations for these individuals. The “-merge-concurrent-muts” option was applied, allowing a single individual to only contribute, at most, a single mutation to the total mutation burden of any one gene. All other default parameters were used. The FDR cutoff was based on the convolution test (CT) method.
150	6141466	BODY26	['METHODS', 'COPY NUMBER ALTERATIONS']	METHODS	Segmentation files and marker files were generated for each sample using existing loss-of-heterozygosity data from genotyping arrays and the correct format was verified by comparison to the example data provided by the documentation. Using these files as input, GISTIC 2.016 was run using the GenePattern web module to call copy number alterations and evaluate cohort recurrence for significantly altered regions (https://genepattern.broadinstitute.org/gp). The supplied hg19 build of the reference genome was used. A germline CNA file was not provided. Default parameters were used for all sections under Additional Parameters and Advanced Parameters. Output file significant calls were verified by manual review using original BAM files in IGV.
151	6141466	BODY27	['METHODS', 'LOSS OF HETEROZYGOSITY']	METHODS	Heterozygous germline variant calls were selected from each patient sample where the normal VAF was within the range of 40–60. Absolute difference between the tumor VAF and 50 was calculated to produce a zygosity score. Segments were generated using the DNAcopy54 circular binary segmentation algorithm, and average zygosity score of constituent variants attributed to the segments. Biomart55 was used to obtain genomic coordinates for each gene and overlap with the segment coordinates, to generate a zygosity score for each gene in each sample. A zygosity score above 30 (representing an average tumor VAF < 20 or >80) was used to call a gene as loss-of-heterozygosity (LoH) (Supplementary table 11). In cases where there was insufficient data to make a segment, the zygosity score was omitted, and no LoH call was made.
152	6141466	BODY28	['METHODS', 'GENE SETS']	METHODS	Cancer relevant genes were collected from Supplementary table 2 of Lawrence et al., and filtered for a pan-cancer q value < = 0.1, as discussed in the main text of that paper (list of genes available in Supplementary table 6). A list of genes participating in canonical WNT signaling was curated from Reactome (Supplementary table 7) after analyzing WNT gene lists R-HSA195721 (Signaling by WNT) and R-HSA-3858494 (β-catenin independent WNT signaling).
153	6141466	BODY29	['METHODS', 'TRANSCRIPTOME ALIGNMENT AND EXPRESSION ESTIMATION']	METHODS	Fasta files were trimmed using Flexbar56 with settings: -adapter-min-overlap 7 -min-read-length 20 to improve read alignments. Reads were aligned by hisat2.0.557 using Ensembl version 74 transcripts. Reads were sorted and indexed by SAMtools 1.3.158 and then used for expression estimation by Stringtie 1.3.359.
154	6141466	BODY30	['METHODS', 'EXPRESSION BATCH CORRECTION AND SAMPLE CLUSTERING']	METHODS	Stringtie expression estimates were loaded by Ballgown60, expression filtered, log transformed, normalized by ComBat61, and clustered with pheatmap (https://github.com/raivokolde/pheatmap) in an ad hoc script available on the methods repository for this manuscript (https://github.com/ahwagner/sclc).
155	6141466	BODY31	['METHODS', 'SSGSEA']	METHODS	Expression estimates were combined with human primary tumor expression data from George et al.3. Data were then manually transformed into a GCT file:
156	6141466	BODY32	['METHODS', 'SSGSEA']	METHODS	(http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/file-formats-guide#_Creating_Input_Files_Tab) and run through ssGSEA v9.0.6 in GenePattern (https://genepattern.broadinstitute.org). Relevant gene sets were selected from MutSigDB (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/genesets.jsp) and downloaded as GMT files. The input and result files (Supplementary table 12) of this analysis are available on the methods repository for this manuscript (https://github.com/ahwagner/sclc).
157	6141466	BODY33	['METHODS', 'SSGSEA']	METHODS	ssGSEA was validated by calculating ssGSEA enrichment scores using an ASCL1 expression signature (as defined by Borromeo et al.)5, and exploring the correlation between ASCL1 enrichment and tumor subtype (ASCL1-high [A], NEUROD1-high [N], and Dual negative [D]). Subtype information for George et al. treatment-naive samples was obtained from the publication by Mollaoglu et al.6 Finally, independently categorized samples were grouped together by subtype for this analysis, to test the ability of ssGSEA to detect true biological differences independent of batch effect. As expected, ASCL1 high tumors from both studies were most enriched for the ASCL1 signature, while dual negatives were the least enriched (one-way ANOVA analysis; p < 0.0001). Similarly, analyses by Mollaoglu et al. and Polley et al. demonstrated high MYC activity in ASCL1-low SCLC samples and cell lines6,62. Using the ssGSEA method, we calculated enrichment scores for MYC activation (using the MYC activation signature defined by Bild et al.) and ASCL1 driven gene expression (defined by Borromeo et al.) and examined their correlation5,62. Once again, independently subtyped SCLC samples were grouped together for this analysis. As expected, MYC activation was inversely correlated with high ASCL1 enrichment scores (linear regression; p = 0.003).

H82 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI. All medias contained 10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep and 1% l-glutamine. Cell lines were validated by STR profiling at the University of Utah DNA Sequencing Core Facility using the GenePrint 24 kit from Promega (Madison, WI, USA) in June and December 2017. Chemotherapy resistant clones of these cell lines were derived from parental lines through repeated in vitro cisplatin and etoposide treatment followed by serial passaging. Targeted Sanger sequencing of APC was performed on these lines.

Supernatants were harvested after 48–72 h and cell lines were infected twice with viral supernatant at 1:1 (media/supernatant) with 1000× polybrene (8 μg/ml). Cells were then selected for 2–3 days in puromycin.

194	5589900	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	Copy number rather than epigenetic alterations are the major dictator of imprinted methylation in tumors
195	5589900	ABS0	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	It has been postulated that imprinting aberrations are common in tumors. To understand the role of imprinting in cancer, we have characterized copy-number and methylation in over 280 cancer cell lines and confirm our observations in primary tumors. Imprinted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) regulate parent-of-origin monoallelic expression of neighboring transcripts in cis. Unlike single-copy CpG islands that may be prone to hypermethylation, imprinted DMRs can either loose or gain methylation during tumorigenesis. Here, we show that methylation profiles at imprinted DMRs often not represent genuine epigenetic changes but simply the accumulation of underlying copy-number aberrations (CNAs), which is independent of the genome methylation state inferred from cancer susceptible loci. Our results reveal that CNAs also influence allelic expression as loci with copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity or amplifications may be expressed from the appropriate parental chromosomes, which is indicative of maintained imprinting, although not observed as a single expression foci by RNA FISH.
196	5589900	ABS1	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	Altered genomic imprinting is frequently reported in cancer. Here, the authors analyze copy number and methylation in cancer cell lines and primary tumors to show that imprinted methylation profiles represent the accumulation of copy number alteration, rather than epigenetic alterations.
197	5589900	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Cancer is the leading cause of death in adults. Tumors themselves are typically classified using pathological criteria and tissue origin. However following the huge investment from large international consortia, cancers can now be sorted into molecular subgroups based on genetic and epigenetic profiles1 which has led to targeted therapies for subtypes with specific alterations.
198	5589900	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	To help with molecular classification, we have investigated whether aberrations at imprinted loci can stratify tumors from different tissue origins.
199	5589900	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	"Genomic imprinting is the parent-of-origin specific monoallelic transcription, regulated in part by allelic difference in DNA methylation established in the male and female germline and maintained throughout somatic development2. In addition to being indispensible for growth, imprinted genes have been suggested to play a crucial role in driving oncogenic switch or suppressing tumor development3. Deregulated expression, which includes the reactivation of the normally silent allele (commonly referred to as loss-of-imprinting, LOI) or the silencing of the transcribed allele, has been implicated in childhood cancer associated with the classical imprinting disorder Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome4. In these cases gains of methylation at the paternally methylated H19 DMR or paternal uniparental disomy (copy-number neutral loss-of-heterozygosity, cnnLOH) result in over-expression of IGF2-miR483 and the concomitant silencing of H19-miR6755. However it is becoming evident that an increasingly number of imprinted genes shows irregularities in adult tumors. For example aberrant expression of transcripts in the H19-IGF2 domain has been reported in more than 15 tumor types, with somatic amplifications of IGF2 and miR483 implicated in the initiation of colorectal cancer5, 6, with copy-number gains being mutually exclusive with P13K pathway-activating mutations7. In addition over-expression of H19-miR675 is frequently observed in colorectal cancers, which suppress the expression of the tumor-suppressor RB1
8. Downregulation of DIRAS3 (also known as ARH1) by either deletion or methylation is frequently observed in breast and ovarian cancers9, 10 and has been implicated in sensitivity to Cisplatin, a widely used platinum-based chemotherapy agent11. Furthermore epigenetic silencing and deletions of L3MBTL1, a member of the polycomb-like family located at chromosome 20q, is associated with hematological malignancies showing increased genome instability12, 13."
200	5589900	BODY3	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Imprinted deregulation has also helped modify our thoughts on the classical genetic events leading to cancer. For example, despite the RB1 gene being at the center of Knudson’s two hit hypothesis in which familial retinoblastoma displays autosomal dominant inheritance with the first hit present in the germline and the second somatically acquired14, this gene is preferentially expressed from the maternal chromosome15. This is evident in epidemiological data from sporadic retinoblastoma patients in which the maternal chromosome 13 is preferentially lost16.
201	5589900	BODY4	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Ignoring placenta-specific imprinted genes17–19, there are currently ~150 transcripts in the human genome mapping to ~30 domains suggesting that other imprinted genes may contribute to the development of cancer in adults. However to date very few studies have systematically looked at the influence of somatically acquired copy-number alterations (CNAs) on imprinted methylation profiles in cancer. We have performed an analysis to determine the association between CNAs and DNA methylation profiles for three cancer cell types originating in the lung, colon and breast which rank among the most frequent solid tumor types, as well as liver, which is a prevalent cause of cancer-associated deaths due to hepatitis B virus infections (https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics). Overall we observe that all four-tumor types show highly aberrant profiles, with a high proportion of aberrant imprinted DMR methylation patterns being associated with cancer-associated CNAs and not somatically acquired epigenetic defects.
202	5589900	BODY5	['RESULTS']	RESULTS	We utilize copy-number and epigenetic data from a large set of cancer cell lines from the Sanger Institutes COSMIC project20, 21 with observations confirmed in cohorts of well-characterized primary cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium7, 22–25. To determine the interplay between CNAs and DNA methylation we combined data from genotyping (Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP6 arrays) and methylation (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips, HM450k) platforms that interrogated 906,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 485,577 CpG dinucleotides, respectively. Our group has previously characterized the Infinium HM450k methylation array for parent-of-origin methylation associated with imprinted regions17. In this study we focused on the 661 probes mapping to 37 imprinted DMRs.
203	5589900	BODY6	['RESULTS', 'CNAS AT IMPRINTED DOMAINS IN CANCER CELL LINES']	RESULTS	"High-resolution copy-number data for each imprinted domain was obtained from COSMIC cell line project that included 173 lung, 50 colorectal, 49 breast and 15 hepatocarcinoma cell lines. We confirmed the CNAs using other low-resolution molecular cytogenetic methods, including SKY karyotyping and standard DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Fig. 1a–c)(http://www.pawefish.path.cam.ac.uk)25. We identify thousands of aberrations including deletions, amplifications and cnnLOH. Copy-number calling was reported as total copy number and minor allele, where a normal diploid state is 2:1 and cnnLOH having a total copy number ≥ 2 and a minor allele count of zero, an event in which one allele is deleted and the remaining one amplified. In all cases an estimated ploidy baseline (total alleles/baseline ploidy) was also calculated for each cell line (Supplementary Data 1 and Supplementary Figs 1–6) since total copy number ≥ 2 could represent amplification in a diploid tumor but a deletion in a hyperploid tumor. No cell lines had normal copy-number at all imprinted domains, with the least affected being the breast-derived CAL-51 cell line that was normal except for cnnLOH of the chromosome 11q15 domains (2:0) and the colorectal cell line LS-180 which had isolated cnnLOH of GRB10 (2:0). The most severe CNAs were observed in lung cancer cell lines, with the PPIEL locus on chromosome 1 being amplified up to 14 times in DMS-273 (14:1) NCI-H378 (14:1) and NCI-H1836 (14:2) with the NCI-H1694 cell line having all copies of one allele (14:0). Such huge gains were not restricted to the PPIEL locus as the MCTS2/HM13 domain was also amplified 14 times in the SKLU-1 cell line (14:2).

205	5589900	BODY8	['RESULTS', 'CNAS AT IMPRINTED DOMAINS IN CANCER CELL LINES']	RESULTS	Next, we wish to determine the size of the CNAs since telomere/centromere bound aberrations tend to be larger than focal internal CNAs24. Indeed we observe that focal internal CNAs incorporating imprinted domains were smaller in 96% of cases and were in higher copy number 79% of the time. For example the average telomere bound amplification for HTR5A on chromosome 7 is 41 Mb, with an average total copy-number of 4.4, whereas internal amplifications are on average 8.5 Mb with >9 copies (Supplementary Data 3). For chromosomes harboring more than one imprinted domain, the CNAs may be focal or involve the entire chromosome arm (Fig. 1c, d)(extended data available at the www.humanimprints.net). This was confirmed using DNA FISH in the breast cancer cell line HCC1954 that has an internal amplification of 15q11.2-12 including SNRPN that does not encompass the nearby centromere (Fig. 1c).
206	5589900	BODY9	['RESULTS', 'CNAS DICTATE IMPRINTED DMR METHYLATION PROFILES']	RESULTS	We hypothesize that CNAs are a major determinant of allelic methylation at imprinted DMRs. To ensure that the profiles obtained using the COSMIC HM450k methylation data set accurately reflected the methylation pattern at imprinted DMRs, we compared the profiles for five cell lines with those obtained using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) generated by ENCODE. Despite the difference in technology, a comparison of the methylation profiles revealed high correlation (Spearman ‘s correlation: A549 r = 0.85, HCT-116 r = 0.79, T47D r = 0.95, HepG2 r = 0.6, MCF7 r = 0.74. P-value < 0.0001) suggesting that the HM450k methylation array data can be used with high confidence (Supplementary Fig. 7). To test our hypothesis, we subsequently compared the absolute methylation (average methylation for all probes within an imprinted DMR) with the CNA-based predicted methylation value. Assuming that no epimutations have occurred, then methylation will be entirely dictated by chromosome number and parental origin. For example for a normal cell with 2:1 copy-number complement, methylation will be ~ 50% as one allele is methylated and the other unmethylated. However for a cell line of 4:1, depending on the parental origin of the minor allele methylation will be in a ratio of 75:25 or 25:75%. In all cases of cnnLOH the methylation profile will be near zero or fully methylated irrespective of the total chromosome number. Any sample with a CNA-based predicted methylation value outside ± 3 s.d. of normal tissue controls were assumed to have a profile not dependent on CNA, and attributed to a failure to maintain the correct epigenetic profile (Fig. 1e). In total 17.6% of all imprinted DMRs in breast-derived cancer cell lines present with methylation changes independent of CNA, whereas only 12.8% lung, 9% liver and 8.1% colon cancer cell posses methylation profiles not corresponding to copy-number. An estimate of the proportion of methylation variability explained by copy-number alone is shown in the supplementary information (Supplementary Fig. 8). The most frequently epimutated regions varied depending on tissue origin, with the maternally methylated ZNF597 DMR being affected in 66.6% of hepatocarcinoma cell lines, H19 in 28.9 % of lung, ZNF331 DMR1 in 32% of colon and GRB10 in 44.9% of breast-derived cancer cell lines.
207	5589900	BODY10	['RESULTS', 'METHYLATION PROFILING AT COPY-NUMBER NORMAL LOCI']	RESULTS	"To obtain a clearer picture of the role of aberrant methylation independent of CNAs, we assessed the allelic methylation asymmetry at imprinted domains in cancer cell lines without copy-number changes. A comparison of the distribution of Infinium HM450k β-values revealed that copy-number normal samples were more frequently hypermethylated rather than failing to maintain methylation, a pattern that was not obvious when all cell lines were analyzed together irrespective of CNAs (Fig. 2a). To confirm the high-density array methylation profiles we performed pyrosequencing for 3 DMRs including NHP2L1, FAM50B and the KvDMR1 (Fig. 2b). The results obtained were extremely similar for the two different methodologies (Spearman’s correlation; NHP2L1 r = 0.88, FAM50B r = 0.97, KvDMR1 r = 0.88), further reassuring us that the array-based methylation profiling is extremely accurate. However, despite being quantitative, pyrosequencing does not give strand-specific or allelic information and averaging β-values for all probes within an imprinted DMR may mask subtle anomalies. For these reasons, we performed bisulphite PCRs and subcloning to confirm some of the rare unexpected array methylation profiles (Fig. 2c). For example we observe complete hypermethylation at the PLAGL1 DMR in the colorectal cell line SW48 but two different profiles in SW837, with the 5′ promoter region being fully methylated whilst the interval encompassing the transcription start site (TSS) has normal allelic methylation. A similar bipartite methylation profile was also observed at the MEG3 DMR in the hepatocarcinoma cell line JHH-4. In addition we observe normal allelic methylation of the L3MBTL1 DMR in breast cancer cell line T47D, with the exception that the ~ 200 bp immediately adjacent to the TSS, which is devoid of methylation. We previously described that the bidirectional promoter associated with the SGCE and PEG10 is a maternal DMR on the telomeric side of a large CpG island, with the opposite side unmethylated in all somatic tissues, except placenta where is also methylated on the maternal allele17. Intriguingly we observe that several cell lines, irrespectively of tissue origin, adopt this placenta profile, which we confirm by PCR in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 (Fig. 2c).Fig. 2Methylation anomalies at imprinted DMRs in cancer cell lines. a Line graphs of the number of cancer cell lines showing methylation defects in imprinted DMRs.

209	5589900	BODY12	['RESULTS', 'THE INFLUENCE OF NEARBY NON-IMPRINTED GENES WITHIN CNAS']	RESULTS	The effect of non-imprinted genes located within the same CNAs as imprinted loci could influence tumor development. In an attempt to understand the impact of additional genes, we identified nine oncogenes and two tumor-suppressor genes that map within the vicinity of the imprinted loci (Supplementary Data 4). In general, the greater the distance between the cancer-associated gene and the imprinted loci the lower the frequency that both regions are involved in the same cytogenetic aberration. However, in many cases both loci are affected. For example, the imprinted PPIEL locus is located ~373 kb from the MYCL1 oncogene and co-amplification of both regions was observed in 98% of lung, 91% in liver, 97% in breast and 100% in colon cancer cell lines harboring copy-number gains of 1p34.
210	5589900	BODY13	['RESULTS', 'THE INFLUENCE OF NEARBY NON-IMPRINTED GENES WITHIN CNAS']	RESULTS	In addition to the classic acquired LOH caused with deletions, we show that cnnLOH is a common chromosomal defect affecting imprinted loci. Since cnnLOH may lead to homozygosity of pathogenic mutations (i.e., silencing tumor-suppressor genes or activating oncogenes) we screened for genes with homozygous mutations mapping within cnnLOH regions harboring imprinted loci. Of the 280 cell lines analyzed, 258 had at least one region of cnnLOH affecting an imprinted loci with 26% also containing homozygous mutated genes described from in the COSMIC database. The majority of mutated genes have not been associated with tumor initiation of progression. However we did identify reoccurring mutations of RB1 associated with cnnLOH of chr13q14 and PTEN mutations with cnnLOH of chr10q23-26 in lung and breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Data 5).
211	5589900	BODY14	['RESULTS', 'THE INFLUENCE OF NEARBY NON-IMPRINTED GENES WITHIN CNAS']	RESULTS	Further analysis of the parent-of-origin of the cnnLOH, as inferred by the methylation profile of the affected imprinted DMRs, suggests that the influence on imprinted gene dosage is complex. For example, cnnLOH for the chr11p15.5 interval involves both the maternally and paternally derived chromosomes equally in breast and lung cancer-derived cell lines, but is exclusively paternal in colon cancer cell lines consistent with previous observations that IGF2 over-expression is oncogenic7. For cases also harboring homozygous mutated genes, it seems that the presence of the genetic variant is more influential than the parent-of-origin of the cnnLOH, with the exception that RB1, in which all lung cancer cell lines (7/7) are associated with hypermethylation at the RB1 imprinted DMR.
212	5589900	BODY15	['RESULTS', 'DMR PROFILES ARE INDEPENDENT OF OTHER EPIGENOME CHANGES']	RESULTS	"Compared to normal cells, cancer cells show drastic changes in DNA methylation status, generally exhibiting global hypomethylation at intragenic and repetitive elements accompanied by regions of hypermethylation. Over the years the various regions of cancer-associated hypermethylation have been defined, initially as a collective of promoter CpG islands prone to gaining methylation known as CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)26. The list of hypermethylated regions is continually expanding with use of technologies with increased genome resolution and now include bivalent domains, CpG-rich sequences decorated with the permissive histone modification H3K4me2/3 and the repressive modification H3K27me3, which represent ~68% of cancer-associated hypermethylated genes27, 28 and DNA methylation valleys (DMVs), large intervals that are generally devoid of DNA methylation in normal tissues29 (Supplementary Data 6). We compared the DNA methylation profiles of 30 CIMP, 442 bivalent domains and 166 DMVs to obtain a general genome methylation profile in each cancer cell line. We observe that cell lines with the greatest number of hypermethylated CIMP regions were also more susceptible to bivalent and DMV hypermethylation (Fig. 3a). To determine if the predominant hypermethylation we observe at imprinted DMRs simply reflects the genome-wide methylation state, we ordered each cell line according to its CIMP profile (i.e., ranked according to the severity and number of affected loci per cell line). Unlike CIMP and bivalent domains that are highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation: colon r = 0.96. Spearman’s correlation: breast r = 0.93, liver r = 0.92 and lung r = 0.93) there was no apparent similarity between CIMP and imprinted methylation for any cancer type (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3The methylation profiles of genomic intervals susceptible to cancer-associated hypermethylation. a Heatmap of pairwise correlation coefficient of for CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), bivalent domains (BIV) and DNA methylation valleys (DMV) in the cell lines derived from the four different tissues.

214	5589900	BODY17	['RESULTS', 'DMR PROFILES ARE INDEPENDENT OF OTHER EPIGENOME CHANGES']	RESULTS	In addition, we assessed a subset of cancer cell lines for hypomethylation of repetitive DNA (ALU-Yb8, LINE-1 and α-satellites). These elements are commonly used as surrogates to measure genome-wide methylation levels as ~ 27% of total CpG methylation is contained within LINE-1 elements and 23% in ALU-Yb8 sequences30. We identified substantial hypomethylation of these elements in numerous cell lines compared to tissue matched controls, but those cell lines affected did not show extreme hyper- or hypomethylation at imprinted DMR (Supplementary Fig. 9). Taken together these observations argue against a direct connection between global DNA methylation status and imprinting, supporting an independent mechanism of regulation in cancer.
215	5589900	BODY18	['RESULTS', 'ALLELIC EXPRESSION PROFILING IN CANCER CELL LINES']	RESULTS	"To date, very few cancer cell lines have been assessed for allelic expression of imprinted genes. To determine the influence of both methylation and CNAs on allelic expression, we genotyped highly informative exonic SNPs within NAPL1L5, PEG10, H19, IGF2, MEST, KCNQ1OT1, MEG3, PEG3, L3MBTL1 and NHP2L1 in 57 cancer cell lines with allelic expression determined by PCR with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) in heterozygous cases (Supplementary Figs 10–19). This revealed that if expressed, copy-number normal cell lines with normal methylation maintained appropriate monoallelic expression (e.g., NHP2L1 in NCI-H441; KCNQ1OT1 in COLO-824, DM-273, HCT-15, NCI-H1048 and MDA-MB-157; MEG3 in Hs-578-T; NAP1L5 in BT-474, GP5d and HCT-15; PEG10 in HCT-116) and in rare cases with robust loss-of-methylation the transcripts were biallelically expressed (e.g., NHP2L1 in HLE). Interestingly we observe several cases in which cell lines with a total/minor ratio of 4:2 with ~50% methylation are also robustly expressed from one genotype, suggesting that the four chromosomes are maintaining their original parental imprints having two active and two repressed chromosome copies (e.g., NHP2L1 in Hs-578-T and NCI-H508, KCNQ1OT1 in AU565 and HCC1954; H19 in LS-411N and LS-1034; L3MBTL1 in NCI-H1975; NAP1L5 in MDA-MB-453). To confirm these expression profiles, we performed RNA FISH for the long non-coding (lnc)RNA KCNQ1OT1 that is retained near the site of transcription. In the breast cell line COLO-824, we observe a single signal consistent with it being copy-number normal and monoallelically expressed, as did the colorectal cell lines HCT-15, confirming the observations by Sunamura et al.31 (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary Fig. 20). We observe two signals in the MCF7 cell line that has cnnLOH for 11p15 (total/minor ratio of 2:0) and absence of methylation at the KvDMR1. Interestingly we also observe two KCNQ1OT1 signals in the copy-number 4:2 HCC1954 cell line consistent with two copies of the paternal allele being expressed in these cells. These observations highlight that fact that a cell may be transcribing from more than one chromosome but maintaining the correct imprinting profile if it carries copy-number aberrations.Fig. 4Allelic expression analysis of KCNQ1OT1 in cancer cell lines. a Three cell lines with different copy-number status (COLO-824, copy number 2:1; HCC1954, copy number 4:2; MCF7 copy number 2:0) were assessed by Sanger sequencing of rs231359 polymorphism in the KCNQ1OT1 transcript in DNA and cDNA, respectively.

217	5589900	BODY20	['RESULTS', 'CONFIRMING IMPRINTED CNAS IN PRIMARY CANCER SAMPLES']	RESULTS	Human cancer-derived cell lines are widely used models to study the biology of cancer and in the majority of cases recurrent genetic and epigenetic change found in tumors are also identified in cell lines and vice versa. In order to confirm our cell lines observations in primary tumors we analyzed publically available data sets from TCGA including breast carcinomas (BRCA), colon adenocarcinomas (COAD), liver hepatocellular carcinomas (LIHC) and lung tumors (lung adenocarcinomas, LUAD + squamous cell carcinomas, LUSC) for which data is available from normal, tumor and adjacent-tissue samples.
218	5589900	BODY21	['RESULTS', 'CONFIRMING IMPRINTED CNAS IN PRIMARY CANCER SAMPLES']	RESULTS	"A huge number of CNAs were observed in the primary data sets encompassing imprinted domains, but in most cases copy-number gains were not as severe as in cell lines and were restricted to the tumor samples and not matched adjacent-tissue (Fig. 5a, b). For many imprinted loci the copy-number aberrations were a mix of both deletions and amplifications, but striking recurrent changes were observed. For example, the four imprinted regions on chromosome 20q (MCTS2, NNAT, L3MTBL1 and GNAS) were invariable subject to copy-number gains with very few deletions observed in the four cancer types. In contrast some imprinted domain were associated with CNAs specific to a tumor type. When observed, H19/IGF2 CNAs in COAD were mainly amplifications, consistent with previous reports7, whereas equal numbers of gains/losses are observed in the other three tumor types analyzed. Furthermore, amplifications of RB1 at chr13q14 were preferentially observed in COAD samples whereas deletions were preferentially observed in BRCA, the latter consistent with the reports of the functional loss of RB1 in basal-like and luminal breast carcinomas32. Similarly chromosome 22q deletions are common somatic alteration in both breast and colorectal cancer33 and we confirm a high frequency of deletions of NH2PL1 mapping to 22q13 in BRCA and COAD data sets.Fig. 5Methylation profiles of imprinted DMRs in primary TCGA cancer samples. a Scatter plots for imprinted domains on chromosome 20 in tumor, adjacent and control somatic DNA reveals that the CNAs are restricted to the cancer samples. b Ideogram for chromosome 20 showing the extent of amplifications and deletions for MCTS2, NNAT, L3MBTL1 and GNAS domains in lung-derived cancer samples.

220	5589900	BODY23	['RESULTS', 'CONFIRMING IMPRINTED CNAS IN PRIMARY CANCER SAMPLES']	RESULTS	Next, we wish to determine the size of the CNAs since we observed that telomere/centromere bound aberrations tend to be larger than focal internal CNAs in cancer cell lines. This was also true for CNAs encompassing imprinted domains in primary cancer samples, with focal internal CNAs being more prevalent and often in higher copy number than those involving either the telomere or centromere (extended data available at the www.humanimprints.net). For example the average telomere bound amplification for IGF1R on chromosome 15 is 18 Mb, often representing just a single additional copy, whereas internal amplifications are on average 3 Mb with 6–7 copies.
221	5589900	BODY24	['RESULTS', 'IMPRINTED METHYLATION IN TCGA DATA SETS']	RESULTS	The methylation changes in the TCGA primary tumor samples are less frequent and less extreme than in cancer cell lines; however, this may reflect cellular composition of the sample with primary tumors being heterogenous and infiltrated with normal cells (mean tumor cell estimate ± s.d.; BRCA 72.2 ± 20.5%, COAD 71.5 ± 16.6%, LIHC 87.1 ± 11.7%, LUAD 76.3 ± 19.1%) (Supplementary Data 7).
222	5589900	BODY25	['RESULTS', 'IMPRINTED METHYLATION IN TCGA DATA SETS']	RESULTS	There was high correlation between hypermethyalted CIMP, bivalent domains and DMVs for all tissues (Spearman’s correlation for CIMP vs bivalent domains: BRCA r = 0.88, COAD r = 0.95, LIHC r = 0.81 and LUAD r = 0.84)(Fig. 5c), with the COAD sample set being more hypermethyalted than the other cancer types (Supplementary Data 8). With the exception of the LIHC samples, the number of imprinted DMRs subject to hypermethylation is much greater than those with hypomethylation (Fig. 5c, d), with no correlation with global DNA methylation status as gauged by comparisons with CIMP, bivalent domains and DMVs (Fig. 5c). Consistent with our observation in cell lines, aberrant imprinted methylation was closely associated with CNAs status (Fig. 5e). To determine whether specific imprinted DMRs were affected in cancer from different tissue origin, we assessed the frequency of methylation defects at loci with normal 2:1 copy-number. No particular DMR was affected in specific cancer type. The most frequently observed hypermethylated regions are PEG13 (60%) in COAD, PPIEL (34%) in LIHC, INPP5FV2 (30%) in BRCA and the paternally methylated ZNF597 DMR (20%) in LUAD. Similarly, no imprinted DMR was consistently hypomethylated, with the most frequently affected regions being GNAS (20%) in LIHC, FAM50B (9%) in LUAD, L3MBTL1 (8%) in COAD and MCTS2 (6%) in BRCA. Furthermore some imprinted DMRs have stable methylation comparable with normal tissues with the LUAD data set having the most unaffected loci (NAP1L5, PLAGL1, PEG10, MEST, PEG3, NNAT and NH2PL1).
223	5589900	BODY26	['RESULTS', 'MOLECULAR SUBTYPES AND IMPRINTED METHYLATION']	RESULTS	The somatic load of driver mutations in the cancer cell lines has been extensive studied, with the results cataloged in the COSMIC somatic mutation database. To determine if methylation defects at imprinted loci were more prevalent in tumors harboring-specific genetic aberrations, we compare methylation profiles of samples with 2:1 copy-number positive for common mutations1. We failed to observe any association between reoccurring mutations (TP53, PIK3CA, CDH1 and AKT1 in breast-derive cancer cell lines; TP53, MLH1, APC, KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA in colorectal cancer cell lines; CTNNB1, TP53, AXIN1, JAK1 and LRP1B in hepatocarcinoma cell lines; TP53, PIK3CA and AKT1 in lung cancer cell lines) or microsatellite instability (MSI) and imprinted DMR status for any cell lines. However we observe increased normal copy-number status in colon, liver and lung-derived cell lines with high MSI, consistent with the previous reports that chromosomal instability and microsatellite stability are largely mutually exclusive34 (Supplementary Figs 21–24).
224	5589900	BODY27	['RESULTS', 'MOLECULAR SUBTYPES AND IMPRINTED METHYLATION']	RESULTS	The primary tumor samples from the TCGA have also been extensive studied at the molecular level allowing similar comparisons to be performed. Comparable to cell lines, we do not observe increased frequency of aberrant imprinted methylation for any characteristic including reoccurring mutations, hepatitis infections and alcohol consumption in LIHC, smoking status in LUAD or HER2, progesterone or estrogen hormone receptor status in BRCA data sets (Supplementary Figs 25–28).
225	5589900	BODY28	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	In this current study, we have generated DNA methylation and CNAs profiles for over 280 cancer cell lines and compared the results with large primary tumor data sets available from the TCGA.
226	5589900	BODY29	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Methylation at imprinted loci is unique in that opposing parental alleles have different methylations states that are dictated by parental origin. Unlike other single-copy regions which may be prone to accumulate cancer associated hypermethylation from an initially unmethylated state, imprinted DMRs can either loose or gain methylation. Importantly cancer-associated copy number changes will influence the absolute methylation observed at imprinted DMRs while this is not so important for CIMP, bivalent domains and DMVs. In the majority of cases, we observe that the methylation profiles at imprinted DMRs do not represent epigenetic changes but simply the parental origin of underlying CNAs. In some cases, we predict methylation errors may have occurred within cytogenetically abnormal genomes, but it is not possible to know which aberration, the CNA or methylation defect, occurred first. In addition, it is impossible to know if all copies of a highly amplified region for example PPIEL or GNAS are subject to epimutations, resulting in a mosaic/clonal state.
227	5589900	BODY30	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	"It is known that some tumors with higher frequency of cancer-associated hypermethylation are enriched for oncogenic mutations. However our detailed analysis was unsuccessful in revealing a clear link with any driver mutation or exposure. Mutations in BRAFV600E
35 and CTNNB1
36 have been described in colorectal and liver tumors with extensively acquired hypermethylation. We fail to identify any association between aberrant imprinted methylation and these two mutations, despite one study in hepatocellular carcinomas reporting enrichment of CTNNB1 mutations in samples with hypomethylation at imprinted loci37."
228	5589900	BODY31	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Direct evidence for the role of LOI and cancer comes from the mouse model, in which biallelic expression of Igf2 present on an Apc(Min) background has an increased incidence of colorectal cancers38. However, human data implicating this locus in sporadic cancer is more controversial. Biallelic expression of IGF2 has been associated with hypomethylation of the H19 DMR in colorectal cancer39, rather than the hypermethylation that would predictably lead to reactivation of the maternal allele of IGF2 by ablation of insulator function. This hypomethylation extends to the IGF2-DMR0 region and was reported to occur in the normal colonic mucosa of patients, suggesting that this epigenetic abnormality is not limited to the tumors. Methylation data from TCGA COAD data set supports the observed hypomethylation at both these paternally methylated DMRs (cg19642877 is the only probe on the HM450k platform mapping within IGF2-DMR0 with methylation somatically acquired DMR, therefore this was not included in our analysis) but there is no evidence for aberrant methylation in adjacent normal tissues (Supplementary Data 9), endorsing the reports that methylation at this regions is not a predisposing constitution biomarker for colorectal cancer40.
229	5589900	BODY32	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Cultured cancer cell lines are widely used models and have help form the fundamental basis for our current understanding of cancer biology. However the use of such an in vitro system has limitations. These include cell line misidentification41 and inter-laboratory clonal expansion or induce secondary genomic changes that may occur since these originally heterogeneous cell lines have been maintained for decades in different culture conditions. To limit these oversights, we have performed our genotyping and methylation analyses on the same DNA samples obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, with quantitative and allelic conformation performed on these DNA aliquots. Furthermore the results of our allelic expression profiling are consistent with examples reported in literature. For example, the methylation and allelic expression of DIRAS3 in the breast cell lines UM159 and CAL51 as reported by Niemczyk et al.42, and the H19 methylation profile of the colorectal cell lines COLO-205 and LoVo are similar to those reported more than 10 years ago43. We also observe identical hypermethylation in the liver cancer cell lines at the RB1 (HLE and HuH-7) and MEG3 DMRs (HLE and HuH-7)44–46 although our data suggests that these profiles are due to cnnLOH.
230	5589900	BODY33	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	While we are confident that our allelic expression results are consistent with previous reports and reflect the expression status in the cell lines, results are sometimes not as would be predicted. For example in the colon cell line HCT-116, we observe robust monoallelic expression despite the H19 DMR being methylated on both alleles. This is further complicated by the fact that the nearby cis-regulated somatic IGF2-DMR0 maintains allelic methylation consistent with previous reports39. In addition the COLO-205 is heterozygous for the reciprocally imprinted, co-regulated H19 and IGF2 genes. However, we observe a discordant expression pattern with maintained monoallelic expression of H19 and biallelic expression of IGF2, a situation that has previous been reported in lung adenocarcinomas47. One possible explanation for the latter observation is that expression of IGF2 has switched from the predominant P3/P4 imprinted promoters to the tissue-specific non-imprinted P1 promoter48. A similar scenario may account for the biallelic expression of MEST observed in many cell lines despite the DMR being hypermethylated, however since the SNP used to discriminate alleles is located beyond PCR range, we are unable to demonstrate promoter switching.
231	5589900	BODY34	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	To conclude, the involvement of imprinting in cancer has gained much attention, but very few studies have taken CNAs into account when reporting methylation profiles. This has resulted in the inflated documenting of somatically acquired epigenetic errors at imprinted loci in cancer. Our data strongly suggest that CNAs should be investigated before reporting an epigenetic change at imprinted loci in cancer.
232	5589900	BODY35	['METHODS', 'DNA SAMPLES']	METHODS	Cell line DNA used for confirmation analyses were obtained directly from the Sanger Institute. All cell lines cultured in-house, except two, were obtained from ATCC repository and grown using conditions recommended by the supplier. The hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines JHH-2 and JHH-449 were obtained from the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation JCRB Cell Bank, Osaka, Japan. These cells were maintained in Eagle’s minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum.
233	5589900	BODY36	['METHODS', 'DNA SAMPLES']	METHODS	Control liver, breast, colon and lung tissue samples were obtained from Catalan Tumor Biobank (http://www.clinicbiobanc.org/) with DNA extracted with phenol/chloroform using phase-lock gel columns (5 Prime) and RNA extracted with Trizol (Thermofisher) following standard protocols. cDNA synthesis was performed using 1ug of RNA following an initial DNase treatment (amplification grade DNase I, Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed with MMLV retrotranscriptase (Promega) and random primers (Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Institutional Review Boards of the Bellvitge Institute for Biomedical Research (PR223/09) and (PR024/11).
234	5589900	BODY37	['METHODS', 'BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS']	METHODS	The Illumina Infinium HM450k methylation data sets for cancer cell lines and primary samples was obtained from COSMIC cell line project (GEO number GSE68379) and TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov), respectively. Pre-processing and normalization were performed following GenomeStudio (Illumina) using the Bioconductor minfi package50. This includes background subtraction and control normalization. After normalization, methylation beta (β) values range from 0 (unmethylated) to 1 (fully methylated). Before analysis, we excluded possible sources of technical bias and genetic variation that could influence results. We discarded, firstly, all probes with a detection P-value > 0.01 in more than 10 % of the samples and secondly, those with missing values in one or more of the tested samples. We also discarded those probes containing a common SNP (minor allele frequency ≥ 1%, dbSNP138) in the flanking 5 bp of the interrogated CpG site. Finally, we removed all probes mapping to the X and Y chromosomes. All analyses were performed using human genome version 19 (hg19) as the reference genome. When applicable, coordinates from hg18 to hg19 version were converted using LiftOver tool from USCS Genome Browser website (https://genome.ucsc.edu).
235	5589900	BODY38	['METHODS', 'BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Epigenetic profiles: Infinium HM450k probes located within bivalent domain, DMV and CIMP regions were extracted according to published coordinates26, 27, 29. For each sample the average β-value of the probes located within each defined interval was calculated. For subsequent methylation analysis, only regions that were uniformly unmethylated (<0.2 average β-value) in normal tissues (n = 19 breast, n = 12 colon, n = 10 liver and n = 7 lung) were selected. We categorized the intervals according to the severity of methylation gains as compared to their corresponding normal tissue controls, being lowly methylated (mean of controls + 0.2), mildly methylated (absolute β-value > 0.5) and highly methylated (absolute β-value > 0.75).
236	5589900	BODY39	['METHODS', 'BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Imprinted methylation analysis: Infinium HM450k probes located within 37 germline imprinted DMRs which have more than one probe were extracted from loci defined by methyl-seq17. For each sample, the average methylation at each imprinted DMRs was calculated. Briefly, we classified hyper/hypomethylated imprinted DMR when averaged β-values are above or below 0.8/0.2. We also calculated intermediate methylation defects when samples show ± 0.2 β-value relative to controls, but the absolute methylation do not reach 0.8/0.2 cutoff values. For each cancer type, methylation analyses for cell lines and TCGA samples were performed independently using the same criteria. For TCGA data set, methylation level of an individual tumor sample was compared to its corresponding non-tumor adjacent-paired tissue, whereas methylation level for each cancer cell line was compared to the averaged β-values of corresponding normal tissue controls.
237	5589900	BODY40	['METHODS', 'RRBS METHYLATION ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Processed-RRBS data for A549, T47D, MCF7, HCT-116 and HepG2 cell lines were downloaded from ENCODE project51 (GEO accession number: GSE27584). At each CpG site, the methylation rate was calculated as the ratio of methylated reads (C) over the total read count (C + T) at that site. Similar to Infinium HM450k data, CpG sites within imprinted DMRs were extracted according to coordinates17 and the average methylation at each imprinted DMR was calculated using RRBS-detected cytosines covered by ≥ 10 reads. The association between methylation level at imprinted DMRs obtained from Infinium HM450k and RRBS methods was assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient.
238	5589900	BODY41	['METHODS', 'RRBS METHYLATION ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Predicted methylation analysis: we obtained Affymetrix Genome-wide SNP6.0 genotyping profile of 287 cancer cell lines and 2676 TCGA primary tissues from the Sanger Institutes COSMIC cell line project and TCGA data portal. A total of 306 cancer cell lines (derived from 51 breast cancers, 54 colorectal cancers; 20 hepatocarcinomas and 181 lung tumors) had Infinium HM450k array data, allowing us to determine the association between CNAs and DNA methylation. At the time of this study (2013 onwards) only 178 TCGA primary tissues had pair data copy-number and methylation data. To obtain the CNA predicted methylation value we first determined the minor methylation value as the ratio between the minor and the total allele count. Then, if this corresponded to an Infinium HM450k value below 0.5, we assume that the methylated allele was the minor one and reported the minor methylation value as the CNA predicted methylation. If the corresponding Infinium HM450k value was above 0.5, we assumed that the methylated allele was the major one and report 1—minor methylation value as the CNA predicted methylation.
239	5589900	BODY42	['METHODS', 'RRBS METHYLATION ANALYSIS']	METHODS	To estimate the proportion of methylation variance explained by copy-number we used univariate linear regression. For each imprinted region and tissue type, we fit a model with the average observed methylation as outcome and the expected-by-copy-number methylation (described above) as predictor, considering the different cell lines as observations and obtaining the corresponding coefficient of determination (R2).
240	5589900	BODY43	['METHODS', 'RRBS METHYLATION ANALYSIS']	METHODS	CNA analysis: We used Level 3 CNA estimations for TCGA samples (BRCA n = 1044; COAD n = 429; LIHC n = 208; LUAD n = 494 and LUSC n = 501). For the cell lines, we used the CONAN copy number estimations. CNAs were selected if they overlapped an imprinted DMR by at least 1 bp. We defined an amplification/deletion to be internal if it was more than 1 Mb away from the corresponding telomere/centromere (whichever is closer). For TCGA data, we utilized all available data (even if no methylation data was available) and estimated copy number using circular binary segmentation algorithm as implemented in PSCBS52.
241	5589900	BODY44	['METHODS', 'RRBS METHYLATION ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Mutation status in cancer cell lines: We obtained mutational data for all cell lines from the repository Cell Line Project release v76 (http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cell_lines).
242	5589900	BODY45	['METHODS', 'GENOTYPING AND IMPRINTING ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Exonic SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.1) within imprinted transcripts were identified in the UCSC hg19 browser and genotypes obtained by PCR and direct sequencing. Sequence traces were interrogated using Sequencher v4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation, MI). Heterozygous sample were analyzed for allelic expression using RT-PCR incorporating the polymorphism within the final PCR amplicon (for primer sequences see Supplementary Data 10).
243	5589900	BODY46	['METHODS', 'BISULPHITE PCR OF CELL LINE-DERIVED DNA']	METHODS	For confirmation of methylation profiles in normal tissues and cancer cell lines standard bisulphite conversion of approximately 1 μg DNA was subjected to sodium bisulphite treatment and purified using the EZ DNA methylation-Gold kit (ZYMO, Orange, CA). Approximately 2 ul of converted DNA was used in each amplification reaction using Immolase Taq polymerase (Bioline) at 45 cycles and the resulting PCR product cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) for subsequent subcloning and sequencing (for primer sequence see Supplementary Data 10).
244	5589900	BODY47	['METHODS', 'PYROSEQUENCING ANALYSIS FOR METHYLATION QUANTIFICATION']	METHODS	Approximately 50 ng of bisulphite converted DNA was used for pyrosequencing of imprinted DMR or repeat elements30, 53. Standard bisulphite PCR was used to amplify the regions of interest with the exception that one primer was biotinylated (for primer sequences see Supplementary Data 10). For sequencing, forward primers were designed to the complementary strand. The pyrosequencing reaction was carried out on a PyroMark Q96 instrument. The peak heights were determined using Pyro Q-CpG1.0.9 software (Biotage). The data were subjected to statistical analysis using Graph Pas Prism 5.0 (Graph Pad Software). Difference between groups were considered significant at P < 0.05.
245	5589900	BODY48	['METHODS', 'DNA FISH']	METHODS	The detection of CNAs involving 15q11-13 was identified using Vysis probes with GABRB3 labeled with SpectrumOrange and the D15Z1 CEP15 labeled with SpectrumGreen (Abbott Molecular Inc.). For the preparation of metaphase spreads, cell lines were exposed to colcemid for 3 h ~24 h after feeding. After treatment with hypotonic solution the cells were fixed in Carnoy’s fixative dropped onto glass slides. Prior to hybridization the slides were dehydrated through an ethanol series of 70, 85 and 100% for one minute each. Heat denaturation, hybridization in humidified chambers and washes were performed following supplier’s recommendations. DAPI-vectorshield mounted slides were visualized with on a Zeiss microscope with images of individual nuclei captured using the automated MetaSystems platform.
246	5589900	BODY49	['METHODS', 'RNA FISH']	METHODS	Expression of the lncRNA KCNQ1OT1 assessed by RNA FISH. Cells were grown on poly-L-lysine coated slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed twice in PBS and permeabilized with 70% EtOH at 4 °C overnight. The fixed slides were washed twice in PBS, followed by two washes in 2× SSC. Control slides were treated with RNAse A (Roche) treatment for 1 h at 37 °C and subsequently washed twice in 2× SSC. A pre-hybridization step involving incubating the fixed slides in 15% formamide/2× SSC for 20 min at room temperature was performed before hybridization. BAC probe RP11-937O11 (obtained from the BACPAC Resource Center) was labeled with either SpectrumRed or SpectrumGreen UTP by nick translation and competed with human COT-1 DNA (Roche) following the supplier’s protocol (Abbott Molecular Inc.). 4 ul of heat denatured probe/LSI buffer was added to non-denatured slides and hybridized overnight at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Subsequently the slides were carefully washed in 2× SSC/15% formamide for 20 min at 37 °C, followed by two washed in 1× SSC at 37 °C for 20 min each. Slides were mounted using DAPI-vectorshield and visualized using a Leica fluorescence microscope. A total of 100 nuclei were counted to determine the number of expression foci per cell.
247	5589900	BODY50	['METHODS', 'DATA AVAILABILITY']	METHODS	The Illumina Infinium HM450k methylation array and RRBS methylation data sets for cancer cell lines were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) accession numbers GSE68379 and GSE27584, respectively.

261	8936524	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance to LSD1 inhibitors in small cell lung cancer occurs through a TEAD4‐driven transcriptional state
262	8936524	ABS0	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	Small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a heterogeneous disease, consisting of intratumoral and intertumoral neuroendocrine (ASCL1 and/or NEUROD1), mesenchymal‐like, and YAP‐driven transcriptional states. Lysine‐specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as KDM1A) inhibitors have recently been progressed to clinical trials in SCLC based on a promising preclinical antitumor activity. A potential clinical limitation of LSD1 inhibitors is the heterogeneous drug responses that have been observed in SCLC cell lines and patient‐derived models. Based on these observations, we studied molecular and transcriptional signatures that predict patient response to this class of drug. Employing SCLC patient‐derived transcriptional signatures, we define that SCLC cell lines sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors are enriched in neuroendocrine transcriptional markers, whereas cell lines enriched in a mesenchymal‐like transcriptional program demonstrate intrinsic resistance to LSD1 inhibitors. We have identified a reversible, adaptive resistance mechanism to LSD1 inhibitors through epigenetic reprogramming to a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like state. Our data suggest that only a segment of SCLC patients, with a defined neuroendocrine differentiation state, will likely benefit from LSD1 inhibitors. It provides novel evidence for the selection of a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like subpopulation resistant to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC patients that may require effective drug combinations to sustain effective clinical responses.

Activity of LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC is confided in cells enriched in neuroendocrine transcriptional programs. Transdifferentiation of SCLC into a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like state represents an acquired resistance mechanism to LSD1 inhibitors. Drug combinations targeting YAP‐TEAD pathways with LSD1 inhibitors may be an effective strategy to target intrinsic‐ and adaptive‐resistant populations and sustain effective clinical responses.

285	8936524	BODY21	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine carcinoma that exhibits aggressive malignancy and a high propensity for early metastasis. In addition to common mutations in RB1 and TP53, molecular profiling studies have identified an epigenetic basis for SCLC disease initiation and progression featuring frequent mutations in chromatin‐modifying genes including CREBBP, EP300, and MLL1/2 as well as alterations in the distribution of DNA methylation [1]. Based on these observations, epigenetic drugs have been explored for therapeutic intervention to target tumor‐specific epigenetic vulnerabilities and reverse acquired epigenetic changes driving tumor growth and survival. Promising in vitro and in vivo preclinical data led to clinical trials exploring the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors including romidepsin or panobinostat in relapsed SCLC. Although both agents were well‐tolerated and demonstrated some evidence of tumor shrinkage and sustained stable disease, both clinical studies failed to demonstrate a significant benefit warranting continued development [2].
286	8936524	BODY22	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	The emergence of a new generation of epigenetic drugs targeting specific transcriptional regulators of SCLC oncogenesis including BRD4, LSD1, and EZH2 has renewed interest in exploring epigenetic therapies in SCLC [3, 4, 5]. Among this class of new epigenetic drugs, inhibitors of the histone lysine demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A) have gained significant attention [6]. LSD1 is a member of the BRAF‐HDAC (BHC) corepressor complex shown to regulate expression of neuronal gene programs through interaction with REST [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In addition to the previously reported antitumor activity in acute myeloid leukemia, LSD1 inhibitors have shown lineage‐specific activity in SCLC cell lines and patient‐derived xenograft models [5, 6, 13, 14, 15]. Although the mechanism of growth arrest conferred by these drugs is unclear, LSD1 has been shown to regulate neuroendocrine transcriptional programs critical for SCLC growth [5, 13]. Several recent reports have suggested that the primary mechanism of action of LSD1 inhibitors in both AML and SCLC occurs not only through catalytic inhibition of LSD1 enzymatic function but also through inhibition of the interaction of LSD1 with SNAG domain transcriptional factors such as INSM and GFI1B [14, 15]. Through these inhibitory mechanisms, LSD1 inhibitors can impact the expression of neuroendocrine lineage‐specific regulators such as ASCL1, required for SCLC lineage specification.
287	8936524	BODY23	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Recent studies have characterized SCLC as heterogeneous population, consisting of intratumoral and intertumoral neuroendocrine (ASCL1/NEUROD1), mesenchymal‐like, and YAP‐driven transcriptional states and subtypes [16, 17]. The particular SCLC subtypes may define vulnerabilities to therapeutic targets. In a breadth of efficacy screen, Mohammad et al. [5] identified only a subset of SCLC cell lines and primary samples with a DNA hypomethylation signature undergoing growth inhibition in response to GSK2879552. Similarly, in a panel of SCLC PDX tumors, Augert et al. [13] identified selective activity of ORY‐1001 only in models capable of NOTCH pathway activation. Moreover, many sensitive SCLC cell lines and primary tumor models display only partial responses to LSD1 inhibition even after long durations of treatment. The recent advancement of both irreversible and reversible LSD1 inhibitors into SCLC clinical trials warrants the study of potential drug resistance mechanisms that may prevent patients from responding to this class of drugs.
288	8936524	BODY24	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	In this study, we have addressed potential intrinsic and acquired drug resistance mechanisms to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC. Utilizing a recently identified gene coexpression network defining SCLC neuroendocrine and mesenchymal states [18, 19], we have identified that sensitivity to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC is confined primarily to cell lines that express neuroendocrine transcriptional programs. Heterogeneous drug responses in SCLC cell lines reflect a preexisting cell intrinsic drug resistance mechanism enriched in cell lines expressing mesenchymal‐like transcriptional programs. Using single cell RNA‐seq and ATAC‐seq, we demonstrate that continuous treatment with LSD1 inhibitors results in the emergence of drug‐tolerant subclones with a de novo mesenchymal‐like transcriptional state driven through a TEAD4 transcription factor program. We also highlight that acquired resistance to LSD1 inhibitors appears as an ‘epi‐stable’ state. Under drug withdrawal, drug‐tolerant SCLC cells transition between mesenchymal and neuroendocrine phenotypes and regain sensitivity to the drug. Collectively our data provide novel insight in the mechanism contributing to heterogeneous responsiveness of SCLC to LSD1 inhibitors, and selection of mesenchymal‐like enriched subclones is likely to present a barrier to effective single‐agent responses in the clinic.

(Derwood, MD, USA) Immunohistochemical staining and evaluation were performed on a single TMA slide containing 200 microarray dot tissue samples representing a broad array of human lung cancer histologic subtypes as well the inclusion of 20 normal lung tissue samples for comparison. Immunohistochemical procedure and staining were developed and optimized with known LSD1‐positive control tissues to ensure proper specificity. Pathologist scoring method for all evaluated TMA cores was semiquantitative and based on a range of tumor cell positivity corresponding to each score, with a score of 1 indicating rare positivity, 2 showing 3–10% positivity, 3 showing 11–30% positivity, and 4 for everything greater than 30.

Bond Polymer Refine (Buffalo Grove, IL, USA, Bond #DS9800) kit with poly‐HRP and 3,3‐diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB substrate chromogen) was used to detect and visualize the LSD1 staining. Finally, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and mounted. The study methodologies conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by Pfizer ethics committee.

Every 3 or 4 days, adherent and suspension cells were collected and 2 mL of cells was transferred to a new 10‐cm2 dishes for subsequent culture. 8 mL of fresh cell culture medium was added to each plate, and drug was added at proper concentrations to each dish. Three aliquots of 1 mL of cells were collected in 1.5‐mL microcentrifuge tube, concentrated by centrifugation to a 100 µL volume, and added to a 96‐well plate. Relative cell numbers were determined either by cell counting of three independent aliquots using a hemocytometer or by CellTiter‐Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
296	8936524	BODY32	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'RNASEQ AND EXPRESSION PROFILING EXPERIMENTS']	METHODS	RNA‐seq was accomplished on SCLC cell lines treated in triplicate with DMSO or 0.3 µm GSK690 for either 3 or 10 days. RNA‐seq libraries were generated following manufacture’s protocols and sequenced paired‐end on the HiSeq 2000 at read length 50 or 100 nt (only for COR‐L88). FastQ data generated by HiSeq were QCed and trimmed before being aligned to the HG19 human reference genome and then quantified using the rsem package [22] The RNA‐seq DE (differential expression) analysis was done by using the deseq r package after rsem [23]. For this analysis, the program used raw counts as input and ran its normalization method using a scaling factor computed as the median of the ratio, for each gene, of its read count over its geometric mean across all lanes.
297	8936524	BODY33	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'RNASEQ AND EXPRESSION PROFILING EXPERIMENTS']	METHODS	The SCLC cell line mRNA expression data were downloaded from CCLE 19Q1 [24]. For differential expression analysis, genes that are not expressed (TPM < 3 in all cell lines) are first removed, and moderated t‐test was conducted using limma package with Empirical Bayes shrinkage [25] in sensitive (n = 10) vs resistant (n = 12) cell lines using log2‐TPM values with FDR multiple testing correction. Differential expression cutoff is set at FDR < 5% and FC > 2. The heatmaps were generated using the complex heatmap package in r [26]. To identify enriched pathways associated with LSD1 sensitivity, we calculated a significance score defined as follows: −log2(FDR) X (difference in mean TPM between sensitive and resistant lines) and loaded this score into GSEA prerank for pathway analysis [27]. The neuroendocrine (NE) and mesenchymal‐like (ML) network signature genes for 53 SCLC CCLE cell lines were defined as previously described [19, 28]. For overlapping analysis between differential genes and NE/ML network genes, hypergeometric test was performed between each gene set, and the median TPM value of NE or ML module genes was plotted with boxplot with two‐sample t‐test on sensitive and resistant cell lines.
298	8936524	BODY34	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'RNASEQ AND EXPRESSION PROFILING EXPERIMENTS']	METHODS	For TCGA SCLC tumor gene expression analysis, the 2015 UCologne RNA‐seq z‐score data were downloaded from cBio portal (https://www.cbioportal.org/). Genes containing NA readings were removed, and duplicated gene names were merged by their mean expression z‐score. This resulted in a total of 18 598 genes in 81 patient tumors. To calculate gene signature scores, the median expression z‐score from each signature was calculated for each tumor. The gene expression heatmap was generated using the complex heatmap package in r [26].
299	8936524	BODY35	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'SINGLE CELL ISOLATION AND SCRNASEQ']	METHODS	NCI‐H69 cells were treated in duplicate with DMSO or 0.3 μm GSK690 for 21 days. The single cell suspension was isolated by passing the harvested cells through a 40‐μm FlowmiTM tip strainer followed by incubation with 0.25% Trypsin‐EDTA in ice for 10 min and at 37 °C for 10 min to get a final concentration of 3 × 105 cells·mL−1. The single cells were then processed through the Chromium 3′ Single Cell Platform using v2 reagents (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) per the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, a total of 6536 single cells were detected with 3603 cells analyzed in the DMSO vehicle group and 2903 in LSD1 inhibitor‐treated group. The cells were partitioned into Gel Beads in Emulsion in the Chromium instrument, where cell lysis and barcoded reverse transcription of RNA occurred, followed by amplification, shearing, and 5′ adaptor and sample index attachment. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 (San Diego, CA, USA).
300	8936524	BODY36	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'SINGLE CELL ISOLATION AND SCRNASEQ']	METHODS	For single cell RNA‐seq analysis, gene‐cell count matrix was generated with Cellranger pipeline (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA). All downstream analyses, including cell filtering, data normalization, and cell clustering, were performed using the r seurat v3 package [29]. In brief, to remove low‐quality data, cells that have unique gene counts between 200 and 6000 and mitochondrial reads < 10% were kept for further analysis. Read counts were then normalized for total counts in each cell, scaled to 10 000, and then log‐transformed. To remove confounding factors associated with assay quality and cell cycle stages, we used SCTransform [30] to regress out percent mitochondrial reads, percent ribosomal reads, and cell cycle S/G2M score in each single cell. Top 3000 variable genes were selected for downstream analysis. To facilitate single cell comparison between control and LSD1 inhibitor treatment, we used Harmony package [31] with default settings to integrate single cell data and used UMAP [32] for two‐dimensional data embedding. Differentially expressed genes between each cluster or control vs drug‐treated cells were called using the Seurat ‘FindMarkers’ function with these parameters: min.pct = 0.2, logfc. threshold = 0.25, with a cutoff of FDR < 5%. Gene expression values or scores in UMAP were capped at 5% and 95% quantile to eliminate outlier bias during data representation.
301	8936524	BODY37	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ATACSEQ AND DATA ANALYSIS']	METHODS	NCI‐H69 cells were treated in triplicate with DMSO or 0.3 μm GSK690 for 21 days. The transposition assay was performed. Briefly, 50 000 nuclei from each sample were used in each reaction with 20 µL of transposition mix and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. qPCR was performed, and eight cycles were performed. The library was purified with Ampure XP beads (A63880, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), quantified using Qubit (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Q32851, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA, USA), and checked for size distribution using 4200 TapeStation (High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape, 5067‐5584, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed with Illumina HiSeq4000 (San Diego, CA, USA) (50 bp PE, Nextera v2 libraries).
302	8936524	BODY38	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ATACSEQ AND DATA ANALYSIS']	METHODS	For ATAC‐seq data analysis, paired‐end sequencing reads for each sample were mapped to hg38 human reference genome with Bowtie 2 [33] using the following parameters: ‐t ‐X 2000 ‐‐no‐mixed ‐‐no‐discordant. Sam files were converted into Bam with samtools. Peak calling was performed with MACS2 [34] using these parameters: callpeak ‐g hs ‐‐nolambda ‐‐nomodel ‐‐shift ‐100 ‐‐extsize 200 ‐‐bdg ‐‐SPMR ‐q 5e‐2. Peaks overlap with ENCODE black list regions were removed from downstream analysis using bedtools. BedGraph files were converted to Bigwig using bedgraphtobigwig [35], and signal tracks were visualized with IGV [36]. To correct for ATAC‐seq bias, we extracted genome‐wide signal at 100‐bp resolution using deeptools [37] and performed quantile normalization on the signal data using the r package preprocesscore (https://rdrr.io/bioc/preprocessCore/). Differential peak calling between the control and drug‐treated samples was performed with DESeq2 [38], using merged peaks between all samples (total 250 646 peaks). Significant differential peaks were defined as follows: FDR < 0.01 & fold change > 2.5, and the mean read count for each peak is > 40% quantile of all mean read count (to remove low signal regions). This results in 548 open peaks and 838 closed peaks after drug treatment. GREAT analysis [39] was performed on the differential peaks to identify pathways associated with the drug treatment. To predict transcription factor (TF) binding perturbed by the drug treatment, we employed chromvar package [40] with the ‘human_pwms_v2 motif’ database to identify TF binding DNA motifs that are significantly open or closed upon treatment. t‐Test with FDR correction was performed on all TF z‐scores to identify significant TF motifs.
303	8936524	BODY39	['RESULTS', 'LSD1 IS HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN SMALLCELL LUNG CANCER RELATIVE TO OTHER LUNG CANCER SUBTYPES']	RESULTS	Overexpression of chromatin modifiers has been shown to influence their function in cancer [41]. In lung cancer, LSD1 mRNA expression is highly expressed in SCLC relative to other lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). Expression datasets from Clinical Lung Cancer Genome Project (CLCGP) [42] confirm LSD1 is also expressed highly relative to other lung cancer subtypes in primary patient samples (Fig. 1B). To further confirm LSD1 expression levels at the protein level, we conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) on a lung cancer tissue microarray. IHC staining confirmed a statistically significantly higher staining intensity in SCLC specimens relative to that of squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma (1‐way ANOVA Fig. 1C,D).
304	8936524	BODY40	['RESULTS', 'LSD1 IS HIGHLY EXPRESSED IN SMALLCELL LUNG CANCER RELATIVE TO OTHER LUNG CANCER SUBTYPES']	UNUSED	LSD1 is highly expressed in small‐cell lung cancer relative to other lung cancer subtypes.

Statistical significance was determined by one‐way ANOVA with Tukey HSD post hoc test for (A), (B), and (D).
305	8936524	BODY41	['RESULTS', 'SCLC CELL LINES SHOW HETEROGENEOUS RESPONSES TO LSD1 INHIBITORS']	RESULTS	Resulting from the observation of high expression of LSD1 in SCLC, we assessed whether SCLC cell lines were dependent on LSD1 activity for their growth. Using two shRNAs targeting LSD1, we observed growth inhibition in the NCI‐H526 cell line that became strongest after 14 days of target knockdown (Fig. S1A). Interestingly, DMS‐114 cells did not appear sensitive to LSD1 knockdown over 14 days even though there was a significant loss of LSD1 protein level by western blot (Fig. S1B).
306	8936524	BODY42	['RESULTS', 'SCLC CELL LINES SHOW HETEROGENEOUS RESPONSES TO LSD1 INHIBITORS']	RESULTS	Several reports have recently described sensitivity in SCLC cell lines to LSD1 inhibitors. To study this further, we profiled drug sensitivity to the FAD reversible inhibitor GSK690 (Ki = 4 nm) [20] as well as the FAD irreversible compound OG‐86 (IC50 = 47 nm) [21] in a panel of SCLC cell lines (Fig. S2). Due to the delayed onset of proliferation changes observed in shRNA experiments, we tested the effects of GSK690 and OG‐86 on SCLC cell line growth in long‐term proliferation assays of 17–21 days. Consistent with shRNA results, we observed differential responses in many SCLC cell lines. In NCI‐H1417, NCI‐H187, and NCI‐H889 cells, dose‐dependent growth inhibition was initially observed at 7–10 days of both GSK690 and OG‐86 treatments with continued effects observed until days 17–21 (Fig. S3A–C). DMS‐114 cells, which were insensitive to LSD1 shRNA knockdown, were also insensitive to both GSK690 and OG‐86 up to 17 days of treatment at concentrations up to 1.0 µm OG‐86 and 1.0 µm GSK690 (Fig. S3D). Treatment with LSD1 inhibitors resulted in cytostatic responses in sensitive SCLC cell lines. In COR‐L88 and NCI‐H1417 cells, an increase in sub‐G1 phase was observed upon 7 days of GSK690 treatment (Fig. S3E) along with an increase in cells in G1 phase (42% G1 for 1 µm GSK690 vs 25% G1 for DMSO in COR‐L88 cells; Fig. S3F). In contrast, GSK690 treatment in NCI‐H526 arrested cell growth without obvious accumulation in any stage of the cell cycle (Fig. S3E). Interestingly, the antiproliferative effects of LSD1 inhibitors plateau in their percent inhibition even after 17–21 days of continuous drug treatment due to the emergence of a subpopulation of slowly proliferative persister cells in NCI‐H1417 and NCI‐H187 cells (Fig. S3). These data suggest that SCLC cell lines possess both intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to LSD1 inhibitors.
307	8936524	BODY43	['RESULTS', 'NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMAL EXPRESSION SIGNATURES STRATIFY SENSITIVITY TO LSD1 INHIBITION']	RESULTS	Across the SCLC cell line panel, 12 out of 29 tested SCLC cell lines showed > 50% growth inhibition in response to 0.3 µm GSK690 treatment at day 17 (Fig. 2A). A nonenzymatic mechanism of action has recently been proposed to account for the antitumor activity of LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC [15]. In our cell panel, we identified that all SCLC cell lines sensitive to GSK690 express SNAG domain proteins INSM1 or GFI1B; however, we also observed examples of INSM1 or GFI1B‐expressing cell lines that were also resistant to the drug (Fig. 2C). Thus, the expression of SNAG domain proteins alone is insufficient to define cell lines that will respond to GSK690.

309	8936524	BODY45	['RESULTS', 'NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMAL EXPRESSION SIGNATURES STRATIFY SENSITIVITY TO LSD1 INHIBITION']	RESULTS	To identify additional biomarkers that predict sensitivity to GSK690, we explored both mutational and gene expression features of SCLC cell lines from available CCLE data [24] LSD1 expression level alone did not correlate with drug sensitivity (Fig. 2B,C). Additionally, using both univariate and multivariate association methods, no mutation significantly correlated with cell line sensitivity (data not shown). Analysis of the cell line gene expression by principal component analysis suggests that cell lines sensitive to GSK690 stratify in a group with distinct transcriptional state compared to insensitive cell lines with exception of NCI‐H526 and NCI‐H1963 cells that appear to be outliers (Fig. S4A). SCLC cell lines can be stratified by neuroendocrine/epithelial (NE) and mesenchymal‐like (ML) features. Using established gene expression markers of these SCLC cell states [16, 17], we found enrichment in GSK690‐sensitive cell lines in expression of epithelial genes, MYCL and EPCAM, and neuroendocrine genes, GRP, DDC, and ASCL1 (Fig. 2B,C and Fig. S5). SCLC cell lines resistant to GSK690 featured higher expression of mesenchymal genes MYC, ZEB1, and VIM (Fig. 2B,C and Fig. S5). These data suggest that neuroendocrine‐like SCLC cell lines may be more sensitive to LSD1 inhibition while mesenchymal‐like SCLC states may confer resistance to LSD1 inhibitors.
310	8936524	BODY46	['RESULTS', 'NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMAL EXPRESSION SIGNATURES STRATIFY SENSITIVITY TO LSD1 INHIBITION']	RESULTS	To experimentally address the intrinsic drug resistance of mesenchymal‐shifted SCLC cells to LSD1 inhibitors, we treated a mesenchymal variant form of NCI‐H69 cells, NCI‐H69V [43] with GSK690. NCI‐H69 cells grow in suspension and show enrichment in NE transcription factors FOXA2, SOX2, LEF1, NCAM, and E‐cadherin (Fig. 2D). In contrast, NCI‐H69V cells grow as adherent cells and express a ML signature‐enriched transcription factors SMAD3, MYC, ZEB1, and VIM [19] (Fig. 2D). In line with our hypothesis, mesenchymal‐shifted NCI‐H69V appeared to be resistant to GSK690 treatment, showing only 22% growth inhibition compared with 85% growth inhibition observed in parental NCI‐H69 cells (Fig. 2D).
311	8936524	BODY47	['RESULTS', 'NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMAL EXPRESSION SIGNATURES STRATIFY SENSITIVITY TO LSD1 INHIBITION']	RESULTS	To further refine the gene expression signature associated with LSD1 inhibitor resistance, we performed differential expression analysis between LSD1 inhibition sensitive and resistant SCLC cells from CCLE cell line data. Using this approach, we identified a differential gene expression signature (FDR < 5% and FC > 2) stratifying cell lines sensitive and resistant to LSD1 inhibitors (Fig. 3A). By performing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) [27] on these differential genes, we found that gene sets of ASCL1 targets, epithelial differentiation, and ZEB1 repressive sites are upregulated in the sensitive cells, whereas EMT, TGF‐beta, and MYC pathway gene sets are significantly upregulated in the resistant cells (Fig. 3B).

The column represents 81 SCLC patient tumors, and the row represents LSD1i signature genes generated from (A). Genes captured for each signature from the TCGA samples were as follows (captured genes/total signature genes): 3426/3471 for NE signature; 1169/1179 for ML signature; 533/568 for LSD1i sensitivity signature; 90/94 for resistance signature. The NE‐ML score was calculated by subtracting the NE score from the ML score for each tumor. Hypergeometric test P‐values are shown.
313	8936524	BODY49	['RESULTS', 'NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMAL EXPRESSION SIGNATURES STRATIFY SENSITIVITY TO LSD1 INHIBITION']	RESULTS	Since sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition was associated with the presence or absence of expression of canonical neuroendocrine and mesenchymal markers in our previous analysis, we compared the GSK690 differentially expressed gene signature to an established gene coexpression network that delineates tumor heterogeneity observed in SCLC tumor samples as neuroendocrine (NE) and mesenchymal‐like (ML) [18, 19]. Aligning the LSD1 inhibition differential expression signature to genes defining the NE (n = 1102) or ML (n = 2663) coexpression networks [19], we found that sensitive cell lines significantly upregulated NE network genes, while resistant lines significantly upregulated ML network genes (Fig. 3C). In addition, genes upregulated in LSD1 inhibitor sensitive cell lines significantly overlapped with NE network genes while genes upregulated in LSD1 inhibitor‐resistant cell lines significantly overlapped with the ML network genes (Fig. S4B). Overall, these data highlight the context specificity of GSK690 activity in neuroendocrine SCLC subtypes and explain the heterogeneous drug responses observed in SCLC cell lines.
314	8936524	BODY50	['RESULTS', 'NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMAL EXPRESSION SIGNATURES STRATIFY SENSITIVITY TO LSD1 INHIBITION']	RESULTS	We next assessed the potential of the LSD1 sensitivity signature in identification of SCLC patients that might be sensitive or resistant to LSD1 inhibition. Using the differential gene expression signatures that stratify cell lines sensitive and resistant to LSD1 inhibitors (Fig. 3A), TCGA 2015 UCologne SCLC patient dataset was analyzed. Patients with high expression of NE genes correlated with genes increased in expression in the LSD1 sensitivity signature score. Conversely, patients enriched in ML signature overlapped with LSD1 inhibitor resistance gene expression (Fig. 3D). Thus, the LSD1 inhibitor gene expression signature defined distinct subsets of SCLC patients that are predicted to be either sensitive or resistant to LSD1 inhibitors.
315	8936524	BODY51	['RESULTS', 'DRUGTOLERANT CELLS WITH MESENCHYMALLIKE STATES EMERGE AFTER LSD1 INHIBITOR TREATMENT']	RESULTS	Small‐cell lung cancer cell lines grow in floating cell aggregates; however, a subset of cell lines will grow attached to tissue culture plastic [44, 45]. Cell lines which grow in suspension tend to express neuroendocrine markers while adherently growing cell lines are enriched in mesenchymal biomarkers [19]. SCLC cells that persist after day 10 of 0.3 µm GSK690 treatment show profound morphologic changes. NCI‐H526 cells changed from loose floating aggregate to tightly adherent spheres (Fig. 4A). COR‐L88 cells changed morphologically and gained adherence to tissue culture‐treated plates at day 12 of GSK690 treatment (Fig. 4A).

317	8936524	BODY53	['RESULTS', 'DRUGTOLERANT CELLS WITH MESENCHYMALLIKE STATES EMERGE AFTER LSD1 INHIBITOR TREATMENT']	RESULTS	Since morphological changes are known to occur in SCLC cells that transition to a mesenchymal state [46], we assessed whether LSD1 inhibitor persister populations shift to a mesenchymal differentiation state. We performed bulk RNA‐seq on four sensitive cell lines (NCI‐H889, NCI‐H1417, NCI‐H69, and COR‐L88) and two insensitive cell lines (NCI‐H82 and NCI‐H1694). At day 10 of GSK690 treatment, a larger number of genes show changes in all four sensitive cell lines, with the majority of genes showing upregulation (FDR < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2) (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, only five genes and 43 genes were significantly altered after 10 days of GSK690 treatment in two GSK690‐insensitive models, NCI‐H82 and NCI‐H1694, respectively (Fig. 4B). Evaluation of common transcriptional changes occurring in sensitive models revealed only seven genes as consistently altered (FDR < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2) in expression at day 10 in all four cells lines (Fig. 4C). However, the data showed more convergence at a pathway level with several common pathways identified showing consistent changes due to GSK690 treatment in the four sensitive cell lines. Pathways associated with genes upregulated by GSK690 treatment are enrichment in epithelial–mesenchymal transition pathway, TGF‐beta signaling, NOTCH signaling, and focal adhesion‐related signaling consistent with the observed changes in adhesion (Fig. 4D, Fig. S4C). Conversely, pathways enriched in genes downregulated by GSK690 treatment did not show overlap between different cell lines and include various signaling pathways (Fig. 4D, Fig. S4C).
318	8936524	BODY54	['RESULTS', 'DRUGTOLERANT CELLS WITH MESENCHYMALLIKE STATES EMERGE AFTER LSD1 INHIBITOR TREATMENT']	RESULTS	Changes in neuroendocrine and mesenchymal markers were also observed at the protein level in GSK690‐sensitive cell models (Fig. S6). COR‐L88 cells showed the strongest shift into a mesenchymal‐like state showing downregulation of neuroendocrine proteins NSE, GRP, NCAM, and CHGA and neuroendocrine transcription factors FOXA2, ASCL1, and SOX2. COR‐L88 cells also showed strong upregulation of the mesenchymal protein VIM. Other GSK690‐sensitive cell models showed only small changes in protein levels across our panel with GRP reduction and ZEB1 and CDH2 upregulation being the most consistent markers of response (Fig. S6). We observed no consistent changes in the protein levels of any neuroendocrine and mesenchymal markers in GSK690‐insensitive cell lines. Importantly, the extent of mesenchymal gene induction in GSK690‐treated SCLC cells does appear comparatively lower relative to what we observed in mesenchymal‐shifted NCI‐H69V cells and thus may represent a ‘partial EMT’ [47].
319	8936524	BODY55	['RESULTS', 'LSD1 INHIBITOR PERSISTER CELLS EVOLVE FROM EPIGENETICALLY DISTINCT SUBPOPULATIONS']	RESULTS	To define the origin of mesenchymal‐like persister cells, we conducted single cell RNA‐seq analysis on NCI‐H69 cells treated with DMSO or 0.3 μm GSK690 for 21 days. Harmony [31] was applied to integrate DMSO and treatment groups so that gene expression within each single cell subpopulation can be directly compared with obtain subpopulation‐specific differentially expressed (DE) genes after treatment (Fig. 5A). To identify distinct cell subpopulations, unsupervised cell clustering was performed and five clusters were selected manually after visualization using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (Fig. 5B and Fig. S7A). Cell subpopulations in Clusters 0 and 3 were increased in 0.3 μm GSK690‐treated group relative to the DMSO group (Fig. S7A). In contrast, cell subpopulations in Clusters 1 and 2 in DMSO group were reduced after 21 days of LSD1 inhibitor treatment (Fig. S7A). There was no significant difference in the Cluster 4 cell subpopulation between DMSO and treated groups. Cluster 2 was identified as a neuroendocrine‐like subpopulation, as neuroendocrine transcriptional factors GRP and ASCL1 were specifically upregulated in this subpopulation (Fig. 5B and Fig. S8A). Both GRP expression and ASCL1 expression were strongly reduced in Cluster 2 after treatment (Fig. S7B). In addition, the mean expression of neuroendocrine markers (NE score) including ASCL1, CHGA, GRP, INSM1, NCAM1, FOXA2, and SOX2 was significantly reduced in Cluster 2 after treatment (Fig. 5C, left), suggesting cells in this cluster are losing NE features. On the other hand, the mean expression of 76 EMT marker genes from the Broad MSigDB Hallmark Signatures (EMT score) was upregulated in multiple cell clusters after treatment, but most significantly increased in Cluster 0 (Fig. 5C, right). This observation is supported by the significant upregulation of EMT and lung cancer survival pathways in Cluster 0 after treatment (Fig. S8B). Altogether, these results highlight the loss of NE cell subpopulation and the emergence of several transcriptionally distinct, mesenchymal‐like populations in NCI‐H69 cells resistant to LSD1 inhibitors.

321	8936524	BODY57	['RESULTS', 'LSD1 INHIBITOR PERSISTER CELLS EVOLVE FROM EPIGENETICALLY DISTINCT SUBPOPULATIONS']	RESULTS	In an attempt to assess the reversibility of the mesenchymal shift observed in LSD1 inhibitor persister cells, we performed drug washout experiments. After 14 days of GSK690 treatment in NCI‐H526 and NCI‐H69 cells, antiproliferative effects occurred concomitant with the upregulation of mesenchymal markers CDH2, SNA1, MYC, VIM, and ZEB1 and the downregulation of neuroendocrine markers GRP, ASCL1, and CHGA (Fig. S9). After 7 days of drug washout, gene expression signatures recovered in both cell lines to levels similar to that observed in DMSO controls. Moreover, after 7 days of drug washout, cells regained sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition to a similar extent as untreated cell lines (Fig. S9). These data suggest that the mesenchymal shift in SCLC cells treated with LSD1 inhibitors is reversible and caused by an ‘epi‐stable’ mesenchymal‐like differentiation state.
322	8936524	BODY58	['RESULTS', 'LSD1 INHIBITOR RESISTANCE OCCURS THROUGH CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY CHANGES FOR GENES ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMALLIKE PROGRAMS']	RESULTS	We next sought to define the extent of epigenetic reprogramming in LSD1 inhibitor drug‐tolerant cells by employing an assay for transposase‐accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC‐seq). ATAC‐seq data in NCI‐H69 cells treated with 0.3 μm GSK690 for 21 days were highly reproducible between biological replicates and showed clear enrichment at specific genomic regions (Fig. S10A). Consistent with observed changes in gene expression, differentially open or closed chromatin accessibility peaks were primarily identified at distal regulatory regions of genes after 21 days of GSK690 treatment compared with controls (Fig. 6A, Fig. S10B). GREAT gene ontology analysis [39] for genes acquiring open chromatin accessibility peaks near regulatory regions suggests enrichment in pathways involved in mesenchyme morphogenesis and regulation of epithelial cell differentiation (Fig. 6B). In contrast, genes that acquire closed chromatin do not show any significant pathway enrichment.

324	8936524	BODY60	['RESULTS', 'LSD1 INHIBITOR RESISTANCE OCCURS THROUGH CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY CHANGES FOR GENES ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROENDOCRINE AND MESENCHYMALLIKE PROGRAMS']	RESULTS	To study the transcription factor programs regulating drug‐resistant SCLC cells, we identified the transcription factor motifs represented in differentially accessible, closed or open, chromatin regions after GSK690 treatment (Fig. 6C,D). We used chromvar [40], a package designed for inferring transcription factor activity from ATAC‐seq based on chromatin accessibility levels at TF binding motifs genome‐wide (Fig. 6C,D). Our analysis demonstrated that NEUROD1/NEUROD2 and ASCL1 DNA binding motifs were significantly closed following GSK690 treatment. The DNA binding motif for TEAD4 is the only significantly opened region with the treatment (Fig. 6C,D). TEAD4 is a downstream mediator of YAP1 activity, which has been previously identified as a possible phenotypic modulator in a subset of non‐neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines [48]. A small molecule, TED‐347, was recently discovered to demonstrate covalent engagement of cysteine to inhibit TEAD4·YAP1 protein–protein interaction and block TEAD transcriptional activity [49]. We treated NCI‐H69 cells with either LSD1 inhibitor GSK690 or combination with TED‐347 for 21 days. Combination treatment with TED‐347 significantly prevented the cell regrowth following the drug withdrawal for up to 21 days (Fig. 6E). Thus, inhibiting TEAD transcriptional activity prevents the acquired resistance of SCLC in response to LSD1 inhibitors. These data indicate that mesenchymal‐like drug tolerance in SCLC cell lines occurs through epigenetic reprogramming mediated through changes in transcription factor programs driven by oncogenic YAP signaling.
325	8936524	BODY61	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	In this study, we have identified common features of intrinsic and acquired drug resistance to LSD1 inhibitors through epigenetic changes in SCLC neuroendocrine transcriptional programs. Epigenetic plasticity is known to contribute to the poor durability of responses of SCLC to current therapies as selection of mesenchymal enriched clones become enriched in refractory disease found in relapse [50, 51]. Many SCLC cell lines analyzed in this study show either no response or only partial response to LSD1 inhibitors even after 21 days of treatment, suggesting many SCLC cell lines either have a preexisting drug‐resistant population or are capable of transitioning to a drug‐resistant state. Experimentally neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines can transition from neuroendocrine into mesenchymal phenotypes when treated with targeted or chemotherapies [19, 44, 45, 50]. This observation is clinically relevant as SCLC tumors are often composed of epigenetically heterogeneous cells with either a neuroendocrine or a mesenchymal profile [18, 19, 50].
326	8936524	BODY62	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Despite early literature suggesting LSD1 inhibitors would be broadly active in numerous cancers including colon, prostate, and breast cancer [12, 52, 53], the generation of more selective LSD1 inhibitors has clarified the extent of LSD1 inhibitor activity primarily in AML and SCLC [5, 54]. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is suggested from the recent reports identifying noncatalytic mechanisms of action of current LSD1 inhibitors being explored in the clinic. Inhibition of the interaction of LSD1 with SNAG domain‐containing proteins INSM1 or GFI1B impacts expression of key neuroendocrine lineage transcriptional regulators in SCLC including ASCL1 [15]. Recently, a specific inhibitor of LSD1 enzyme activity has been discovered, T‐448 [55], which has minimal impact on the interaction of the LSD1‐CoRest complex with SNAG domain transcription factors. In our studies, T‐448 has no antiproliferative effect on NCI‐H69 cells after 21‐day treatment (Fig. S11), suggesting that the mechanism of action of LSD inhibitors occurs primarily through disruption of the interaction of LSD1 with SNAG domain transcription factors. Our data demonstrate that all cell lines sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors express either INSM1 or GFI1B; however, a subset of cell lines resistant to the drug also express these genes. Thus, the expression of these SNAG domain‐containing proteins alone does not predict sensitivity to LSD1 inhibitors. Interestingly, LSD1 has been found to interact with the SNAG domain of SNAIL and implicated in the transcriptional repression of epithelial markers during EMT transition in breast cancer cells [56]. The role of LSD1 in the SNAG domain of targeted proteins appears to be context and lineage specific.
327	8936524	BODY63	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Our results demonstrate that SCLC cells which have evolved non‐neuroendocrine, mesenchymal‐like transcriptional programs are resistant to LSD1 inhibition. These findings are consistent with Mohammad et al., [5] who identified TGF‐beta pathway signatures negatively correlate with LSD1 inhibitor sensitivity in SCLC. The TGF‐beta pathway is known to regulate EMT pathways in cancer as well as in normal development [46]. In cell lines sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors, we did observe enrichment for TGF‐beta pathway genes as well as genes involved in axonal and EMT pathways after LSD1 inhibitor treatment. Therefore, these data are potentially consistent with our observation that neuroendocrine and mesenchymal differentiation markers stratify sensitivity of SCLC cell lines to LSD1 inhibitors. Augert et al. also identified heterogeneous responses to the LSD1 inhibitor ORY‐1001 in a screen of SCLC patient‐derived xenograft (PDX) models [13]. In their study, PDX models capable of NOTCH activation and concomitant ASCL1 downregulation were enriched in response to LSD1 inhibition. In gene expression studies following GSK690 treatment, we did observe induction of NOTCH pathway genes in COR‐L88 and NCI‐H1417 cells but not to the same extent in NCI‐H69 or NCI‐H889 cells. This suggests that NOTCH pathway‐independent mechanisms of LSD1 inhibitor response exist in SCLC.
328	8936524	BODY64	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	This study highlights the remarkable plasticity of SCLC to evolve into drug‐resistant mesenchymal‐like states. Along these lines, we found expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1 was downregulated after GSK690 treatment in most models with the exception of NCI‐H526 cells which shows a very low expression level of ASCL1 and is reported that the interaction between LSD1 and SNAG domain protein GFI1B plays a key role in this cell line [15]. The extent of mesenchymal gene induction in GSK690‐treated SCLC cells does appear comparatively lower relative to what we observed in mesenchymal‐shifted NCI‐H69V cells and thus may represent a ‘partial EMT’ [47]. In support of this model, drug washout experiments suggest these changes are ‘epi‐stable’ as cells revert to neuroendocrine phenotypes within 7 days of drug removal. Additionally, we found many SCLC cell lines analyzed in this study show only partial response to LSD1 inhibitors even after 21 days of treatment, suggesting many SCLC cell lines are capable of transitioning to a drug‐resistant state. Single cell RNA‐seq suggests that this resistant population likely represents an acquired drug‐tolerant state represented by transcriptional reprogramming that is maintained under drug selection. Consistent with this finding, ATAC‐seq data in NCI‐H69 cells highlighted a shift in the utilization of transcription factors from ASCL1 to TEAD4 in drug‐resistant cells. Interestingly, the expression of TEAD4 and downstream YAP and TAZ have recently been highlighted to represent a unique subtype of non‐ASCL1‐driven SCLC [48]. Our data suggest that inhibiting TEAD transcriptional activity may be an effective strategy to prevent the acquired resistance of SCLC in response to LSD1 inhibitors.
329	8936524	BODY65	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	A recent phase I study of GSK2879552 in relapsed or refractory SCLC found a disease control rate of 14% (four of 29 patients) [57]. High rates of adverse events, including thrombocytopenia and encephalopathy, lead to the termination of the study. Our data suggest that only a segment of SCLC patients, with a defined neuroendocrine differentiation state, will likely benefit from LSD1 inhibitors. In LSD1 inhibitor‐treated patients, a mesenchymal‐like resistant population is likely to persist. Thus, emphasis should focus on drug combination approaches that can sustain clinical responses by eliminating cells that maintain residual disease. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that SCLC cells treated with chemotherapy [50] or radiotherapy [58] obtain mesenchymal characteristics that confer drug resistance. Thus, the efficacy of LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC patients heavily pretreated with chemotherapy will be an important consideration. The recent disclosures of additional LSD1 inhibitors, IMG‐7289, INCB059872, and CC‐90011, under clinical development for SCLC highlight the importance of clarifying the mechanism of action as well as further defining the clinical application of these drugs [6].
330	8936524	BODY66	['CONCLUSIONS']	CONCLUSIONS	We discovered that epigenetic plasticity contributes to heterogeneous responsiveness of SCLC to LSD1 inhibitors. Sensitivity to LSD1 inhibitors in SCLC is confined primarily to cells that express neuroendocrine transcriptional programs. Selection of a TEAD4‐driven mesenchymal‐like subpopulation is likely to present a barrier to effective single‐agent responses in the clinic. Drug combinations targeting the YAP‐TEAD pathways in combination with LSD1 inhibitors may be an effective strategy to target intrinsic and adaptive mesenchymal‐like resistant populations and sustain effective clinical responses.

347	9722452	ABS0	['SUMMARY']	ABSTRACT	Tumor heterogeneity plays a critical role in tumor development and response to treatment. In small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), intratumoral heterogeneity is driven in part by the Notch signaling pathway, which reprograms neuroendocrine cancer cells to a less/non-neuroendocrine state. Here we investigated the atypical Notch ligand DLL3 as a biomarker of the neuroendocrine state and a regulator of cell-cell interactions in SCLC. We first built a mathematical model to predict the impact of DLL3 expression on SCLC cell populations. We next tested this model using a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) to track DLL3 expression in vivo and a new mouse model of SCLC with inducible expression of DLL3 in SCLC tumors. We found that high levels of DLL3 promote the expansion of a SCLC cell population with lower expression levels of both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine markers. This work may influence how DLL3-targeting therapies are used in SCLC patients.

354	9722452	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Tumors consist of a variety of cancer and non-cancer cells. Both cancer cells and non-cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment display various levels of heterogeneity. This heterogeneity may vary over time and environmental conditions, and it plays an important role in tumor development, including shaping the natural response of tumors to the immune system or treatment in the clinic (reviewed in1,2,3,4).
355	9722452	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	SCLC is an aggressive subtype of lung cancer with fast growth rates and a striking metastatic ability. The median overall survival of SCLC patients has remained close to 8–10 months in the past 3 decades, with a 5-year survival at ∼6% and over 200,000 estimated deaths worldwide every year. Most tumors respond well initially to standard-of-care chemoradiation treatment, but resistance emerges rapidly in nearly all cases (reviewed in5). The recent approval of T cell immune checkpoint inhibitors has been beneficial to only a small fraction of SCLC patients (reviewed in6). There is a critical need to develop biomarkers for SCLC development and more efficient therapeutic strategies.
356	9722452	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	SCLC tumors harbor few non-cancer cells7 but inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity is still a prominent feature of these tumors. At the epigenetic/transcriptional level, SCLC tumors have been classified into different subtypes based on transcriptional programs driven by specific transcription factors in cancer cell populations, with the SCLC-A (expressing the ASCL1 transcription factor) and SCLC-N (expressing the NEUROD1 transcription factor) neuroendocrine subtypes being the most frequent in patients.8,9,10 Importantly, mounting evidence indicates that individual SCLC tumors are comprising heterogeneous populations of cancer cells with different levels of neuroendocrine gene programs.11,12,13 As an example of this intratumoral heterogeneity, in SCLC-A tumors, activation of Notch signaling can reprogram neuroendocrine (NE) cancer cells toward less/non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) phenotypes.12 The non-NE cells are less tumorigenic and genetic and pharmacologic approaches to promote NE to non-NE differentiation have been shown to decrease SCLC tumor growth.14 But non-NE can support the survival of the NE cells, including when tumors are treated with chemotherapy.12,15 In this context, the mechanisms activating Notch signaling are not completely understood, but may depend on the YAP transcriptional regulator.16 As another example, in SCLC-N tumors, expression of c-MYC can activate Notch signaling, which also promotes the transition of these tumors to a less neuroendocrine phenotype.17 These data and data from human tumors indicate that both inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity are likely key contributors of the ability of SCLC tumors to become resistant to therapies.8,18,19
357	9722452	BODY3	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	DLL3 (Delta-like ligand 3) is an atypical ligand for NOTCH receptors initially studied for its role in early pattern formation in mouse embryos.20,21,22 Early work showed that DLL3 does not activate Notch signaling but rather functions as an inhibitor of Notch signaling in a cell autonomous manner,23 possibly in a cis-inhibition mechanism in the Golgi.24,25 However, genetic studies of DLL3 O-fucosylation indicate that interactions with NOTCH may not fully account for the physiological function of DLL3, suggesting possible Notch-independent roles for DLL3 in vivo.26 The mouse Dll3 gene is a direct target of ASCL127 and DLL3 is expressed in a significant number of human SCLC tumors. Importantly, Saunders and colleagues showed that DLL3 is present at the surface of SCLC cells and that targeting DLL3-expressing SCLC cells using an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) can eradicate SCLC in pre-clinical models.28 Clinical trials using Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T), an ADC targeting DLL3, have been unsuccessful largely because of toxic side effects of this molecule (e.g.,29,30,31). However, other strategies are being developed to target DLL3 expressing cells, (e.g.,32,33,34,35) and DLL3 remains a target of interest for detection and treatment of SCLC.
358	9722452	BODY4	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Here we developed tools and models to further investigate the role of DLL3 as a biomarker of SCLC and as a regulator of Notch signaling in SCLC. We used mathematical modeling based on published data to predict the potential role that DLL3 expression may have on tumor heterogeneity. We further developed a new single-chain fragment variable (scFv) that can bind DLL3 on cells in culture and in vivo. Finally, we used this scFv to test our mathematical models in a new genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC with inducible expression of DLL3. Our data show variable levels of DLL3 expression in SCLC and indicate that DLL3 expression contributes to intratumoral heterogeneity.
359	9722452	BODY5	['RESULTS', 'MODELING THE ROLE OF DLL3 IN NOTCH-DRIVEN INTRATUMORAL HETEROGENEITY IN SCLC']	RESULTS	DLL3 is often viewed as a cis-inhibitor of Notch signaling during development because of its role in localizing NOTCH receptors in the Golgi (Figure 1A). To determine if DLL3 could suppress Notch activity in SCLC cells, we used cells derived from tumors in the Rbfl/fl;p53fl/fl;Rbl2fl/fl;Hes1GFP/+ mouse model of SCLC (RPR2;Hes1GFP model, also known as TKO;Hes1GFP, for triple knockout).12,16 In this model, SCLC cells express GFP when the Hes1 promoter is active. Because Hes1 is a target of Notch signaling, GFP expression can serve as a reporter of Notch activity, and HES1GFP-positive (HES1pos) cells are less/non-neuroendocrine.12,16 We isolated HES1pos cells from RPR2;Hes1GFPmutant tumors, and ectopic expression of FLAG-tagged DLL3 in these HES1pos cells led to fewer GFP-positive cells, providing further evidence that DLL3 can suppress Notch signaling in cis in this SCLC context (Figures 1B–1D and S1A).Figure 1Mathematical model of mutual inactivation shows production rate-dependent role of DLL3(A) Schematic of Notch, DLL1, and DLL3 interactions in lateral inhibition with mutual inactivation (LIMI).(B) Schematic of HES1GFP-positive cells from an RPR2;Hes1GFP tumor serving as a reporter cell line, with GFP expression from the Hes1 locus to monitor the effect of ectopic DLL3 expression in regulating Notch activity.(C) Flow cytometry of HES1GFP-positive cells with (blue) and without (black) ectopic expression of DLL3 (representative of n = 4 biological replicates).(D) Percentage of GFPhigh HES1GFP-positive cells with and without ectopic expression of DLL3.

371	9722452	BODY17	['RESULTS', 'MODELING THE ROLE OF DLL3 IN NOTCH-DRIVEN INTRATUMORAL HETEROGENEITY IN SCLC']	RESULTS	In the Notch signaling pathway, activation of NOTCH receptors by their ligands, including Delta-like proteins (DLLs), leads to NOTCH cleavage, releasing the NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD). NICD induces transcription of the gene coding for HES1, which is an inhibitor of ASCL1, which is itself an activator of the expression of NOTCH ligands (DLLs, representing DLL1/3/4 and Jagged1/2 here).27,36 This negative feedback leads to lateral inhibition and distinct cell fates among neighboring cells: low NOTCH/high DLL (‘sender’) cells and high Notch/low DLL (‘receiver’) cells (Figure 1A).37 To gain a better understanding of the consequences of DLL3 expression on Notch signaling and intratumoral heterogeneity in SCLC, we built a simple mathematical model by incorporating DLL3 in the canonical mutual inhibition model of lateral inhibition38 using the following reactions: (1) NOTCH receptors, denoted N, bind to DLL1 (as a representative of all NOTCH ligands, denoted D) in trans, which leads to cleavage of NOTCH and release of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), denoted S; (2) NICD increases expression of HES1, denoted H39; (3) HES1 inhibits expression of DLL127,36; (4) NOTCH receptors bind to DLL1 and DLL3, denoted D3, in cis, which inhibits NOTCH cleavage.23,25,40 As expected, setting the production rate of D3 at 0 replicated the results from previous studies on mutual inactivation38,41supporting patterning even without cooperative regulatory feedback in the lateral inhibition model (Figures S1B–S1G). We simulated this model using 1600 parameter sets across a two-dimensional parameter space spanning a wide range of production rates of D (βD) and D3 (βD3) (Figure 1E and Equations (1), (2), (3), (4) in STAR methods section, and Table S1 for parameter values). To represent multicellular interactions, a two-dimensional hexagonal cell lattice was used for each parameter set. We plotted log(Hmax/Hmin), where Hmax and Hmin are the maximal and minimal HES1 levels in the hexagonal lattice at the steady state, respectively, as a function of βD and βD3 to observe parameters leading to lateral inhibition, or heterogeneity in HES1 level.42
372	9722452	BODY18	['RESULTS', 'MODELING THE ROLE OF DLL3 IN NOTCH-DRIVEN INTRATUMORAL HETEROGENEITY IN SCLC']	RESULTS	The cis-inhibition model shows that when βD3> βD, HES1 heterogeneity mostly does not occur, indicating effective inhibition of cell-type bifurcation (Figure 1E). Within the parameter regime leading to heterogeneity, βD3 also regulates the ratio of receiver (HES1high) cells and sender (HES1low) cells, with higher number of sender cells as βD3 increases (Figure 1F). We next examined Hmax and Hmin separately. Hmax consistently decreases as βD3 increases (Figure 1G). Of interest, a large region of parameter space shows higher Hmin with increasing DLL3 (Figures 1H and 1I). Hmin increases throughout the parameter regime that leads to heterogeneity, peaking near βD3 = βD, and gradually decreases as βD3further increases (Figure 1H).
373	9722452	BODY19	['RESULTS', 'MODELING THE ROLE OF DLL3 IN NOTCH-DRIVEN INTRATUMORAL HETEROGENEITY IN SCLC']	RESULTS	In this system, our mathematical modeling suggests that the influence of DLL3 on the heterogeneity of HES1 level depends on the level of DLL3 expression. At high levels (βD3>> βD), DLL3 inhibits both heterogeneity and Notch activation. At lower levels, however, DLL3 allows trans-interaction between NOTCH and other DLLs while preventing lateral inhibition, which leads to homogeneous intermediate NOTCH activation throughout the cell population. In the parameter space leading to heterogeneity, DLL3 expression also affects sparsity of the receiver cells.
374	9722452	BODY20	['RESULTS', 'GENERATION AND VALIDATION OF A SINGLE-CHAIN FRAGMENT VARIABLE (SCFV) BINDING DLL3']	RESULTS	Given that differences in DLL3 expression level may contribute to intratumoral heterogeneity via NOTCH-driven patterning, we sought to examine whether DLL3 levels in tumors were related to the amount of NOTCH signaling or intratumoral heterogeneity present in vivo. To do this, we first developed a new tool to detect DLL3 in tumors in vivo.
375	9722452	BODY21	['RESULTS', 'GENERATION AND VALIDATION OF A SINGLE-CHAIN FRAGMENT VARIABLE (SCFV) BINDING DLL3']	RESULTS	Single-chain fragment variables (scFvs) have several advantages over antibodies, including their small size and their ease of production in bacteria.43,44 We generated a His-tagged scFv based on the sequence of an antibody targeting DLL3 (Methods) (Figures 2A and S2A). We first tested the binding of this scFv targeting DLL3 in 293T cells expressing exogenous DLL3 compared to controls. Flow cytometry analysis using an anti-His antibody showed increased binding in cells expressing mouse DLL3 (Figures 2B and 2C). Using the same approach, we were also able to detect endogenous DLL3 expression in human SCLC cell lines (Figures 2C and S2B). Thus, this scFv targeting DLL3 is capable of binding to DLL3 expressed on the surface of SCLC cells in culture.Figure 2Detection of DLL3 expression at the surface of cells using an anti-DLL3 scFv(A) Schematic representation of the His-tagged scFv targeting DLL3 (aDLL3scFv) and the detection of cells expressing DLL3 using this molecule.(B) Representative flow cytometry analysis of DLL3 expression in 293T cells expressing exogenous mouse DLL3 using aDLL3scFv (from n = 3 biological replicates).(C) Quantification of DLL3 detection in 293T-DLL3 cells from (B) and human SCLC cell lines.(D) Schematic representation of AF680-labeled aDLL3scFv (aDLL3AF680).(E) Representative flow cytometry showing binding activity of aDLL3AF680 (from n = 3 biological replicates).(F) Quantification of (E) in human SCLC cell lines.(G) Whole body fluorescent images of H82 tumor xenografts with 2 nmol of AF680-labeled scFv injected via the tail vein (left).

386	9722452	BODY32	['RESULTS', 'GENERATION AND VALIDATION OF A SINGLE-CHAIN FRAGMENT VARIABLE (SCFV) BINDING DLL3']	RESULTS	To determine if this scFv molecule (aDLL3scFv) could be useful to detect SCLC tumors in vivo, we directly labeled the amino groups of lysine residues and the N-terminal group of the aDLL3scFv with Alexa Fluor 680 (AF680), a near-infrared fluorophore with strong tissue penetration that is suitable for in vivo imaging (Figure 2D). We first verified that the AF680-labeled aDLL3scFv (aDLL3AF680) still detected DLL3 on the surface of 293T cells expressing exogenous DLL3 as well as SCLC cells in culture (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2C). Noninvasive optical imaging was performed over a 6-h time period following tail-vein injections with 2 nmol of aDLL3AF680 in NSG mice bearing subcutaneous xenografts (H82 model). Whole-body fluorescent imaging showed prominent signal in the tumor area, as well as in the kidney (where the scFv molecules are excreted) 2–3 h post injection (Figures 2G and 2H). Maximum tumor-to-normal tissue contrast was observed 2 h post injection (Figure S2D). Signal from the fluorescent scFv was strong after 1 h and started to decrease after 3–4 h, as expected for a small molecule with a short half-life (Figure 2G).
387	9722452	BODY33	['RESULTS', 'EXOGENOUS EXPRESSION OF DLL3 IN MOUSE SCLC TUMORS']	RESULTS	Notch signaling is a driver of non-neuroendocrine cell fates and intratumoral heterogeneity in SCLC,12,17 and our mathematical modeling predicts that DLL3 may contribute to Notch signaling activity and may modulate heterogeneity. We next sought to test this idea experimentally in the RPR2 mouse model of SCLC where this heterogeneity has been described.12,16 In this model, intra-tracheal instillation of an adenoviral vector expressing the Cre recombinase initiates tumors modeling the SCLC-A subtype of human SCLC. SCLC cells in these tumors express DLL3 at their surface (Figure S3A).
388	9722452	BODY34	['RESULTS', 'EXOGENOUS EXPRESSION OF DLL3 IN MOUSE SCLC TUMORS']	RESULTS	To manipulate DLL3 levels in this model, we generated a new allele to conditionally induce DLL3 expression upon Cre-mediated recombination (Rosa26LSL-Dll3 allele) (Figure 3A). We crossed this allele to the RPR2 model (RPR2;Rosa26LSL-Dll3 mice) and initiated tumors by Ad-CMV-Cre instillation. As controls, we used RPR2;Rosa26LSL-Luc mice.45 Tumors developed in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 mice, and their histology was indistinguishable from that of RPR2;Rosa26Luc mice; whereas we did not generate enough mice to rigorously quantify tumor number and tumor burden, we did not observe any striking difference in tumor development between the two models (Figure 3B). A cell line derived from a RPR2;Rosa26Dll3mutant lung tumor grew as spherical clusters in suspension typical of neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines12 and showed weak but detectable expression of the tdTomato reporter linked to DLL3 expression, as well as the expected recombination of the Lox-STOP-Lox cassette, validating the new allele (Figures 3A, S3B, and S3C).Figure 3DLL3 expression perturbs the balance between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells in a mouse model of SCLC(A) Schematic representation of the Cre-inducible Dll3 allele and the genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC.(B) Representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of sections from RPR2;R26Luc and RPR2;R26Dll3mutant lungs (top, scale bar 1 mm) and lung tumors (bottom, scale bar 100 μm) 6 months after tumor initiation (n ≥ 6 mice).(C) Representative flow cytometry analysis of DLL3 cell surface expression in SCLC cells from RPR2;R26Luc and RPR2;R26Dll3mutant mice 5.5 months after tumor initiation.(D) Quantification of (C) (n = 5 independent experiments).(E) As in (C) with RPR2;R26Luc SCLC cells differentiated by NCAM and ICAM expression.(F) Quantification of (E) (n = 6 independent experiments).(G) Representative flow cytometry dot plots of control cancer cells from RPR2;R26Luc tumors with no stain, stained cells from RPR2;R26Luc tumors, and stained cells from RPR2;R26Dll3 tumors (from left to right).(H–J) Quantification of NCAMhigh ICAMlow, NCAMlow ICAMhigh, and NCAMlow ICAMlow populations in (G).Unpaired t-test, data represented as mean ± s.d. ∗p<0.05, ∗∗p<0.01, ∗∗∗p<0.001.

399	9722452	BODY45	['RESULTS', 'EXOGENOUS EXPRESSION OF DLL3 IN MOUSE SCLC TUMORS']	RESULTS	We analyzed tumors from RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 and RPR2;Rosa26Lucmutant mice ∼5–6 months after tumor initiation for DLL3 expression using aDLL3scFv. In control RPR2;Rosa26Luc tumors, we observed two populations of cancer cells, as would be expected for tumors with neuroendocrine (high DLL3) and less/non-neuroendocrine (low DLL3) cells (Figures 3C and 3D). We validated this using NCAM and ICAM staining, with NCAMhigh ICAMlow cells representing neuroendocrine cells and NCAMlow ICAMhigh cells representing less/non-neuroendocrine, as validated previously by RNA-sequencing of these two populations from RPR2 tumors16 (Figures 3E and 3F). In RPR2;Rosa26Dll3mutant tumors, we observed fewer cells with low levels of DLL3 and a more homogeneous population of cells expressing intermediate/high levels of DLL3 (Figures 3C and 3D), indicating that the Rosa26Dll3 allele can elevate DLL3 expression on the surface of DLL3low cells but does not result in further overexpression on the surface of DLL3high cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Similarly, although NCAMhigh ICAMlow cells express higher level of DLL3 compared to NCAMlow ICAMhigh, no significant difference was detected between those of NCAMhigh ICAMlow cells and cells from RPR2;Rosa26Dll3mutant tumors (Figures 3E and3F).
400	9722452	BODY46	['RESULTS', 'EXOGENOUS EXPRESSION OF DLL3 IN MOUSE SCLC TUMORS']	RESULTS	We next quantified HES1 expression as a marker of intratumoral heterogeneity in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 and RPR2;Rosa26Lucmutant tumors, with HES1high cells being Notch-active and less/non-neuroendocrine. As expected, we found regions with variable numbers of HES1-positive cells12,16 (Figure S3D). However, we did not detect any significant change in heterogeneity based on this marker between the two groups (Figure S3E). Although these experiments indicate that higher levels of DLL3 in tumors do not block the ability of SCLC cells to undergo a transition to a NOTCH-driven HES1-positive state, we reasoned that immunostaining may not be quantitative enough to identify more subtle changes.
401	9722452	BODY47	['RESULTS', 'EXOGENOUS EXPRESSION OF DLL3 IN MOUSE SCLC TUMORS']	RESULTS	We used flow cytometry to compare the expression of NCAM and ICAM in primary lung tumors from RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 and RPR2;Rosa26Luc mice (Figure 3G). Compared to RPR2;Rosa26Luc tumors, we found that RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors exhibited a significant decrease in the NCAMlow ICAMhigh non-neuroendocrine population with no significant change in the NCAMhigh ICAMlow neuroendocrine population (Figures 3G–3I). The change in the NCAMlow ICAMhigh population was reflected by an increase in NCAMlow ICAMlow cells in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors (Figures 3G and 3J).
402	9722452	BODY48	['RESULTS', 'EXOGENOUS EXPRESSION OF DLL3 IN MOUSE SCLC TUMORS']	RESULTS	The relatively homogeneous population in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors suggests that higher expression of DLL3 in SCLC cells can inhibit the cell-fate bifurcation process mediated by the Notch signaling pathway. These observations support a model in which DLL3 contributes to Notch signaling activity in SCLC in vivo.
403	9722452	BODY49	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Here we investigated the role of the atypical NOTCH ligand DLL3 in a mouse model of SCLC. In our three-pronged approach, we combined mathematical modeling, a new scFv molecule that binds DLL3, and a new allele to induce DLL3 expression in mouse cells. We found that DLL3 expression contributes to the generation of specific subpopulations of SCLC cells, supporting a role for DLL3 in Notch signaling and in the control of intratumoral heterogeneity in SCLC.
404	9722452	BODY50	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	The Notch pathway is a highly conserved signaling mechanism implicated in both normal development and the progression of various cancer types. In different tissues, Notch signaling provides a binary fate switch through a biochemical feedback mechanism known as lateral inhibition, which regulates differentiation into different cell types from an initially homogeneous field of cells (reviewed in46,47). Thus, the Notch signaling pathway promotes cell fate “bifurcation” rather than a specific cell fate. This contribution of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition to intratumoral heterogeneity has been investigated extensively in multiple settings, including breast cancer,48 glioblastoma,49 and bladder cancer.50 To examine a potential role of the atypical NOTCH ligand DLL3 in SCLC in the classical Notch signaling circuit, we incorporated DLL3 in the lateral inhibition model with a mutual inactivation model. Our mathematical modeling predicts that DLL3 expression can affect Notch signaling in several ways. As expected, when the production rate of DLL3 exceeds that of DLL1 (βD3> βD) heterogeneity sharply decreases, indicating that DLL3 effectively reduces lateral inhibition. Within the parameter regime of heterogeneity, DLL3 expression modulates the relative number of HES1pos cells, making them sparser with increased DLL3 expression. Of interest, although very high production rates of DLL3 (βD3≫ βD) lead to inhibition of Notch activation in the entire population, over a wide range of parameters DLL3 expression maintains an intermediate level of Notch activation, which peaks near βD3 = βD. This observation reflects two seemingly opposing effects on Notch signaling. Low levels of DLL3 are sufficient to inhibit lateral inhibition, reducing or preventing the rise of HES1low cells. At very high levels, DLL3 inhibits Notch activation entirely through complete cis-inhibition. In between these two states, the trans-activation of Notch by DLL1 reinforces intermediate Notch activity, even within the parameter regime that leads to the homogeneous state. Thus, in the context of SCLC, our theoretical framework predicts that although high levels of DLL3 promote the HES1low phenotype (neuroendocrine), at lower levels they can lead to a hybrid phenotype that is neither HES1low nor HES1high. When we examined the role of DLL3 experimentally in these processes, we found that ectopic expression of DLL3 in HES1pos cells results in decreased HES1 expression, supportive of a cis-inhibitory function for DLL3. It is worth noting however, that the presence of DLL3 at the cell surface of SCLC cells could also in theory result in effects in trans on Notch signaling. This has not been described yet but should be the focus of future work, as it may affect our model and the interpretation of our experiments, as well as our general understanding of the Notch pathway.
405	9722452	BODY51	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Intriguingly, induction of DLL3 in a mouse model of SCLC revealed that this ectopic expression decreases the relative number of cells in the non-neuroendocrine (NCAMlow ICAMhigh) population and increases that of a NCAMlow ICAMlow population, without significantly altering the neuroendocrine (NCAMhigh ICAMlow) population of cancer cells. This result suggests that DLL3 inhibits the bifurcation of SCLC cell fates. In future studies, it will be interesting to examine the exact nature of the NCAMlow ICAMlow population in RPR2;Rosa26Dll3 tumors, such as whether these cells represent a precursor cell similar to lung epithelial cells during early lung development before Notch signaling is activated or another population of non-NE cells that do not require Notch.51 Our new mouse allele for DLL3 expression may also be useful in the future to investigate how DLL3 plays Notch-dependent and Notch-independent roles both in developmental processes and in cancer.
406	9722452	BODY52	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	The “fit-for-purpose” approach for biomarker assays is a useful way to think how such biomarkers assays should be tailored to the intended use of the data generated by these assays.52,53 In the case of DLL3, because several therapeutic approaches currently in clinical development rely on the expression of DLL3 on SCLC cells, validating DLL3 expression at the surface of cancer cells before and during treatment could benefit patients with SCLC. Precise monitoring of DLL3 levels in SCLC cells could be used to track overall progression of SCLC and, as our data suggest, heterogeneity between SCLC cell subpopulations. PET imaging of DLL3 has been evaluated clinically using DLL3 targeting antibodies with promising results.54 However, slow normal tissue clearance and requirement of radioisotopes with long half-lives hamper clinical application of antibodies as noninvasive imaging agents.55 Here, we generated an anti-DLL3 scFv (∼1/8th the size of an antibody) labeled with a fluorophore (aDLL3AF680) with tissue penetration, allowing noninvasive optical imaging. aDLL3AF680 successfully labeled SCLC tumors in vivo with good tumor-to-normal tissue contrast in a short time frame (2 h post injection). Fast clearance may lead to a superior imaging agent for clinical application. Small size may allow better tissue penetration. Thus, scFv DLL3 binder may be a great alternative to full-length antibodies for in vivo detection and targeting of DLL3 in SCLC and other tumor types expressing this molecule on their surface.
407	9722452	BODY53	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion, our modeling and experimental data point to a role for DLL3 in the regulation of Notch signaling in SCLC. One implication of our work relates to the outcome of patients treated with therapies targeting DLL3. It is very likely that SCLC tumors may evolve to stop expressing DLL3 as a mechanism of resistance to these therapies. Although we have not performed loss-of-function experiments in mice, loss of DLL3 may, similarly to its overexpression, alter the identity of populations of SCLC cells in tumors. This may in turn lead to a specific new round of therapy, with neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine cells responding differently to different therapies, including immunotherapies activating T cells.56,57 DLL3 remains a promising target in SCLC and other small cell neuroendocrine tumors,28,58,59,60,61,62 which warrants further studies of the biology of this molecule in normal and cancer cells.
408	9722452	BODY54	['DISCUSSION', 'LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY']	CONCLUSIONS	Our mathematical modeling of the role of DLL3 in SCLC heterogeneity is limited to two dimensions, and it will be important in the future to model and investigate DLL3 in three-dimensional models, where cell-cell interactions are more similar to a tumor context. Our analyses of mice with ectopic expression of DLL3 have been limited to one time point during the tumorigenic process, and it is possible that the role of DLL3 may be different at other time points or during/after therapy. Recent studies have identified multiple subtypes of SCLC driven by transcriptional regulators such as ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and others. For a comprehensive examination of how the Notch signaling pathway regulates SCLC heterogeneity, further classification and characterization involving more subtypes will be required.

416	9722452	BODY62	['STARMETHODS', 'EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS', 'MOUSE MODELS']	CONCLUSIONS	Cre-inducible DLL3-overexpressing mice (R26Dll3) were generated by knocking in a Lox-Stop-Lox-Dll3-IRES-tdTomato cassette into the Rosa26 allele. The mice were generated by GenOway via homologous recombination into the Rosa26 allele in mouse embryonic stem cells, and clones were then injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice with germline transmission. The Dll3 sequence in this allele is a cDNA/gDNA combo that retains intron 6 within the cDNA sequence to allow for expression of potential splice variants.

422	9722452	BODY68	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'SYNTHESIS OF ANTI-DLL3 SCFV']	CONCLUSIONS	Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with anti-DLL3 scFv46 with C-terminal hexahistidine tag in pET vector by VectorBuilder. The transformed cells were grown overnight in LB agar plates with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. A single colony from each plate was inoculated in LB broth containing ampicillin and grown overnight. The primary culture was diluted 1:100 and grown at 37°C. When OD600 reached 0.5, the cells were induced with IPTG 0.5mM at 37°C for 6 h. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 g, and the cell pellet was resuspended with B-PER reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific 90,084) with lysozyme (0.1 mg/mL) and DNase I (50 μg/mL) and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min, and the supernatants were purified using a nickel-NTA affinity column (Qiagen 30,210). Centrifugal filters with molecular 10 kDa molecular weight cutoffs (Millipore UFC801024) were used for further purification and buffer exchange into PBS. Protein purity was further analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantified using a plate reader.
423	9722452	BODY69	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'AF680 DYE CONJUGATION']	CONCLUSIONS	Purified scFv was buffer-exchanged to 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) and concentrated to 3 mg/mL. AF680 succinimidyl ester (Thermo Fisher Scientific A20008) was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mg/mL and added to the protein solution to give a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. The reaction was incubated for 1hat room temperature. Unreacted dye removal and buffer exchange to PBS was done using a 10 kDa centrifugal filter.

The cells were then washed twice with PBSB and analyzed by flow cytometry. For testing unlabeled aDll3scFv, cells were incubated with 50 μL of 30 μg/mL aDll3scFv for 1 h in PBSB at 4°C. The cells were washed once with PBSB, and secondary binding was performed on ice for 30 min using rabbit anti-hexahistidine antibody (Cell Signaling Technology 12698S) diluted 1:100 in PBSB. The cells were washed once with PBSB and incubated with goat anti-rabbit antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen A11008) diluted 1:100 in PBSB for 30 min on ice. The cells were then washed twice with PBSB before being analyzed by flow cytometry.
425	9722452	BODY71	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS']	CONCLUSIONS	1 × 106 NCI-H82 SCLC cells in 100 μL 50% Matrigel/50% RPMI media supplemented with 2% bovine growth serum were implanted into the left flank of 7- to 8-week-old NSG mice. For imaging, mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and injected with 2 nmol of aDLL3AF680 in 100 μL of PBS via the tail vein. Imaging was performed at 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after protein injection, using a Lago-X system (Spectral Instruments). The near-infrared fluorescence of AF680 was detected using 615–665 nm for excitation and 695–770 nm for emission. For each imaging, a mouse treated with vehicle only was included to measure the background autofluorescence. For ex vivo imaging, mice were euthanized and organs were excised and imaged using the same excitation and emission as for the in vivo imaging.

441	8770597	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	Plasticity in the Absence of NOTCH Uncovers a RUNX2-Dependent Pathway in Small Cell Lung Cancer
442	8770597	ABS0	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	Neuroendocrine to non-neuroendocrine plasticity supports small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumorigenesis and promotes immunogenicity. Approximately 20–25% of SCLCs harbor loss of function (LOF) NOTCH mutations. Previous studies demonstrated that NOTCH functions as a SCLC tumor suppressor, but can also drive non-neuroendocrine plasticity to support SCLC growth. Given the dual functionality of NOTCH, it’s not understood why SCLCs select for LOF NOTCH mutations and how these mutations impact SCLC tumorigenesis. In a CRISPR-based genetically-engineered mouse model of SCLC, genetic loss of Notch1 or Notch2 modestly accelerated SCLC tumorigenesis. Interestingly, Notch-mutant SCLCs still formed non-neuroendocrine subpopulations, and these Notch-independent, non-neuroendocrine subpopulations were driven by Runx2-mediated regulation of Rest. Notch2-mutant non-neuroendocrine cells highly express innate immune signaling genes including STING and were sensitive to STING agonists. This work identifies a Notch-independent mechanism to promote non-neuroendocrine plasticity and suggests that therapeutic approaches to activate STING could be selectively beneficial for SCLCs with NOTCH2 mutations.
443	9534498	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	POU2AF2/C11orf53 functions as a coactivator of POU2F3 by maintaining chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity
444	9534498	ABS0	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), accounting for around 13% of all lung cancers, often results in rapid tumor growth, early metastasis, and acquired therapeutic resistance. The POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3) is a master regulator of tuft cell identity and defines the SCLC-P subtype that lacks the neuroendocrine markers. Here, we have identified a previously uncharacterized protein, C11orf53, which is coexpressed with POU2F3 in both SCLC cell lines and patient samples. Mechanistically, C11orf53 directly interacts with POU2F3 and is recruited to chromatin by POU2F3. Depletion of C11orf53 reduced enhancer H3K27ac levels and chromatin accessibility, resulting in a reduction of POU2F3-dependent gene expression. On the basis of the molecular function of C11orf53, we renamed it as “POU Class 2 Homeobox Associating Factor 2” (POU2AF2). In summary, our study has identified a new coactivator of POU2F3 and sheds light on the therapeutic potential of targeting POU2AF2/POU2F3 heterodimer in human SCLC.
445	9534498	ABS1	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	C11orf53 is a new coactivator of POU2F3 that is critical for enhancer activity, chromatin accessibility, and SCLC cell viability.
446	9534498	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide (1). Specifically, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive and lethal form of malignancy that develops within tissues of the lungs and is typically diagnosed at later stages when it has already metastasized (2–4). Although SCLC consists of approximately 13% of all lung cancer cases, it has one of the lowest 5-year survival rates and a very poor prognosis (5).
447	9534498	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Recent studies have made advancements in the classification of SCLC defined by relative expression of four major molecular subtypes of key lineage-specific transcription and cotranscription regulators: achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1; SCLC-A), neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NEUROD1; SCLC-N), yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1; SCLC-Y), and POU class 2 homeobox 3 (POU2F3; SCLC-P) (6). Analysis of the morphological features have further indicated that SCLC can be classified into neuroendocrine (NE)–high (SCLC-A and SCLC-N) or NE-low (SCLC-Y and SCLC-P) subtypes on the basis of the expression pattern of different NE markers and the diversity in genetic alterations, growth properties, and immune infiltration (7–10).
448	9534498	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Previously, we have identified an essential epigenetic coregulator and biomarker, additional sex combs-like protein 3 (ASXL3), which is associated with the SCLC-A molecular subtype. ASXL3 functions as a scaffold protein that links histone H2A deubiquitinase BAP1 and the bromodomain-containing protein BRD4 at active enhancer and drives lineage-specific transcriptional programming (11). Therefore, our study suggested that it is necessary to globally identify and study these subtype-specific essential factors to gain a more in-depth understanding of underlying mechanisms regulating SCLC tumorigenesis that may potentially assist in treatment decisions for SCLC and create a much-needed individualized strategic approach.
449	9534498	BODY3	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	For instance, the SCLC-P subtype, which is defined by the expression of a master transcription factor, POU2F3, is known to be a variant form of SCLC that lacks NE features (12). However, identifying other contributing factors in the progression of SCLC-P, specifically a cofactor of POU2F3 function, has yet to be determined. Through our current dependency data analysis and subsequent biochemical and genetic studies, we have identified a previously uncharacterized gene, C11orf53, as a codependent gene of POU2F3. In these studies, we have comprehensively uncovered an essential role of C11orf53 as a coactivator of POU2F3 in regulatory gene expression to establish the cell identity of the SCLC-P subtype.
450	9534498	BODY4	['RESULTS', 'LANDSCAPE OF SCLC SUBTYPESPECIFIC DEPENDENCY']	RESULTS	Global gene expression profiling has been widely used to define molecular subtypes in human cancers (13, 14), including lung cancer (6). However, not all highly expressed genes are essential for tumor cell growth or cell viability. Therefore, to identify the functional subtype-specific dependent factor within the four SCLC molecular subtypes, we used Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) SCLC cell lines (15) encompassing all four subtypes (6) defined previously and explored the genes that are most selectively essential to each subtype compared to the other classifications. Following the criteria for target gene effect score (≤−0.5; median difference <0.2 versus median value of the average of all other groups), we identified 48 genes for SCLC-A, 88 genes for SCLC-N, 66 genes for SCLC-P, and 177 genes for SCLC-Y subtypes defined as being selectively essential in each SCLC subtype (Fig. 1A and table S1). The expression levels of these genes were compared with no global up- or down-regulation in each subgroup (fig. S1A). The essential genes in each subtype are enriched in distinct pathways (Fig. 1B), suggesting that each subtype may depend on a unique set of signaling pathways for cell survivability and proliferation. Next, we highlighted the top genes that are essential or redundant in each subtype (Fig. 1C), revealing the nonoverlapping essentiality profiles in these subtypes. The gene effect scores of the four markers—ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1—showed the selective dependency (Fig. 1D), which is consistent with previous studies for the function of each gene.

452	9534498	BODY6	['RESULTS', 'IDENTIFICATION OF C11ORF53 AS A NEW MARKER FOR SCLC-P SUBTYPE']	RESULTS	Previous studies have identified that the transcription factor POU2F3 is a master regulator of a tuft cell–like variant of small cell lung cancer (12). Therefore, POU2F3 has been widely used to define the SCLC-P subtype. On the basis of our dependency data analysis in Fig. 1A, we noted that the gene dependency score related to a gene called chromosome 11 open reading frame 53 (C11orf53; fig. S2A) is selectively higher in rank (1 of 66) versus POU2F3 (2 of 66) in its significance to maintain the integrity of SCLC-P subtype (Fig. 2A). C11orf53 is an uncharacterized gene that is an evolutionarily conserved sequence from zebrafish to human (fig. S2, B and C) and is expressed at high levels in all four SCLC-P cell lines examined (fig. S2D).

The cell viability was determined by cell counting assay, n = 3, two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05. (F) NCI-H526 and NCI-H211 cell lines were transduced with either nontargeting CRISPR sgRNA or C11orf53-specific sgRNAs for 4 days. The cell morphology was shown under bright field microscopy.

HSP90 was used as an internal control. A total of 1 × 106 of NCI-H526 SCLC cells were transduced with either nontargeting sgRNAs or two distinct C11orf53 sgRNAs that were then inoculated into the right flank of athymic nude mice, n = 8 per group. The tumor growth was measured using a calibrated caliper every 2 to 3 days. Weltch’s t test was used for statistical analysis (H). When each tumor reached 1 cm3, a mouse was euthanized and the survival probability was shown in (I). Log-rank test was performed.
454	9534498	BODY8	['RESULTS', 'IDENTIFICATION OF C11ORF53 AS A NEW MARKER FOR SCLC-P SUBTYPE']	RESULTS	The C11orf53 gene encodes for a 288–amino acid protein product without any known functional domain/motif or cellular localization signal. When analyzing the codependency scores of top genes that are selectively essential in SCLC-P subtype, POU2F3 and C11orf53 have an overall correlation coefficient of 0.812 in the SCLC-P subtype compared to 0.357 in all 17 SCLC cell lines (Fig. 2B). This prompted us to investigate the functional relationship between C11orf53 and POU2F3 in P-subtype SCLC. In published SCLC patient samples (EGAS00001000925), we have detected a strongly positive correlation between the expression levels of POU2F3 and C11orf53 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, this gene may function as a new biomarker for SCLC-P subtype cells.
455	9534498	BODY9	['RESULTS', 'IDENTIFICATION OF C11ORF53 AS A NEW MARKER FOR SCLC-P SUBTYPE']	RESULTS	To study the function of C11orf53 in SCLC cells, we generated our homemade polyclonal antibody for C11orf53 (fig. S2E) and detected the protein levels of C11orf53 in four different SCLC cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2D, we have detected very high levels of C11orf53 protein in the NCI-H526 and NCI-H211 SCLC-P subtype cell lines. In contrast, there were no detectable signals from NCI-H510 nor NCI-H1963 non–SCLC-P subtype cell lines. Genetic depletion of C11orf53 by two distinct CRISPR single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in SCLC cells markedly reduced cell viability (Fig. 2, E and F). To further determine how this gene contributes to cell viability, we examined the protein levels of several factors involved in both cell cycle regulatory checkpoints and apoptosis from two different SCLC-P cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2G, in both SCLC-P cell lines, we found that genetic depletion of C11orf53 via CRISPR knockout could induce cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate–ribose) polymerase (PARP), caspase 3, and caspase 7. In addition, loss of C11orf53 protein also induces a notable cell cycle arrest, as shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in NCI-H526 cells (fig. S2F). In summary, our results suggest that the C11orf53 gene is critical for the maintenance of SCLC-P cell viability. Consistent with the in vitro cell growth results, genetic depletion of C11orf53 in the in vivo xenograft model significantly repressed tumor growth (P = 0.0033; Fig. 2H) and delayed further progression of disease in mice (P = 0.0023; Fig. 2I).
456	9534498	BODY10	['RESULTS', 'C11ORF53 REGULATES LINEAGE-SPECIFIC GENES EXPRESSION AT SUPER ENHANCERS']	RESULTS	To understand how C11orf53 globally affects gene expression in SCLC cells, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in the NCI-H526 cell line transduced with either nontargeting CRISPR sgRNA or two distinct C11orf53-specific sgRNAs. As shown in Fig. 3A, we found a total of 3719 and 3259 genes that were significantly down- and up-regulated, respectively, upon genetic depletion of C11orf53. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) pathway analysis had identified several key cellular growth biological processes, such as Myc and E2F signaling pathway–dependent gene signatures, which were markedly down-regulated upon genetic depletion of C11orf53 (Fig. 3B). To understand how this small protein regulates gene expression, we first sought to determine the cellular localization of C11orf53 by cell fractionation assay. Unexpectedly, we found that the C11orf53 protein could be detected in the cytosol, soluble nuclear, and chromatin (insoluble nuclear) fractions (Fig. 3C), although it obviously has no nuclear localization signal. To further investigate how this protein regulates gene expression at the chromatin, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) with two of our homemade polyclonal antibodies. On the basis of our ChIP-seq analysis, both of our antibodies showed a consistent performance and the peaks are highly correlated (fig. S3, A and B). In general, we have detected 8820 C11orf53-specific peaks in NCI-H526 cells (Fig. 3D). We found that most of these peaks were localized at intergenic or intron regions, indicating that C11orf53 may regulate gene expression at distal enhancer elements. In addition, the motif analysis has identified POU2F3 motif being matched the top hit (P value, 1 × 10−3053) at C11orf53 peaks (Fig. 3E). This result implies that there might be a similar functionality or genetic interaction between POU2F3 and C11orf53 within SCLC-P subtype cells.

458	9534498	BODY12	['RESULTS', 'C11ORF53 REGULATES LINEAGE-SPECIFIC GENES EXPRESSION AT SUPER ENHANCERS']	RESULTS	To further characterize the function of C11orf53 at the genome-wide scale and understand how C11orf53 regulates gene expression at distal enhancers, we divided all C11orf53 peaks into four clusters based on k-means clustering. As shown in Fig. 3F, we have detected a very significant overlap between enhancer marker H3K4me1 and C11orf53 peaks. Both of cluster 1 and 2 peaks are also enriched with active enhancer marker H3K27ac, suggesting that C11orf53 may function as a transcriptional activator at active enhancers. We further integrated our RNA-seq data with the ChIP-seq data and identified the expression change of the genes that are nearest to C11orf53 peaks (table S2). As shown in the middle panel of Fig. 3F and fig. S3C, we found that genes nearest to cluster 1 peaks are markedly reduced upon C11orf53 depletion, where very broad H3K4me1 peaks were detected. As shown in Fig. 3G, most of the super enhancer (SE)–associated genes (table S3) are reduced after C11orf53 depletion. In general, around 66% (71 of 108) SE-associated genes are occupied by C11orf53 (table S4), in which 73.2% (52 of 71) genes were down-regulated upon C11orf53 depletion (fig. S3D). Pathway analysis with genes nearest to cluster 1 peaks show a significant enrichment in several neuronal function and differentiation pathways (fig. S3E). Next, to further confirm the role of C11orf53 involvement in regulating SE-associated genes, we determined the gene expression profiles within cells treated with either dimethyl sulfoxide or JQ1 (table S5). As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3 (F and G) and fig. S3 (F to I), the JQ1 treatment has induced a very similar change in the gene expression profile as C11orf53 depletion. The SCLC-P subtype cells are tuft cell–like variant of small cell lung cancer, which express tuft cell–like specific markers, such as SOX9, GFI1B, and PTGS1. Notably, these tuft cell–like specific genes were down-regulated after C11orf53 depletion or JQ1 treatment (Fig. 3H and fig. S3J).
459	9534498	BODY13	['RESULTS', 'LOSS OF C11ORF53 REDUCES ENHANCER ACTIVITY AND CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY']	RESULTS	Because C11orf53 occupies active enhancers and is critical for maintenance in the expression levels of the enhancer-nearby genes, we asked whether loss of C11orf53 affects the protein levels of enhancer histone marks, such as H3K4me1 and H3K27ac. We conducted Western blot in cells transduced with either nontargeting CRISPR sgRNA or two distinct C11orf53 sgRNAs. As a result, we found that loss of C11orf53 expression does not affect the bulk of histone modifications (Fig. 4A). Next, we conducted ChIP-seq to determine whether there were locus-specific changes in active enhancer marks (H3K4me1/H3K27ac levels). As shown in Fig. 4 (B and C), C11orf53 genetic depletion strongly reduced H3K27ac levels and a moderate reduction in H3K4me1 levels. Then, we centered the log2 fold change of H3K4me1/H3K27ac levels at the previously defined four C11orf53-specific clusters in Fig. 3F. As shown in Fig. 4D, we have detected a very strong reduction of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 histone marks near C11orf53 peaks. Consistently, there is also a marked reduction of SE signals in C11orf53-depleted cells (Fig. 4, E and F). Last, we conducted transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-seq) experiments to determine whether the chromatin accessibility has been altered in C11orf53-depleted cells. As a result, we have detected a total of 55,111 ATAC-seq peaks with 7805 of those peaks being occupied by C11orf53 (Fig. 4G). We further separated the total ATAC-seq peaks into two groups, depending on whether they were cobound with C11orf53 or not. As shown in Fig. 4H, we found that group 1 peaks (ATAC-seq+/C11orf53+) were strongly reduced upon both sgRNA treatments [Fig. 4, H (left) and I, and fig. S4, A and B], while group 2 peaks (ATAC-seq+/C11orf53−) were not significantly reduced upon C11orf53 genetic depletion (Fig. 4H, right, and fig. S4C). In summary, our results have shown a novel function of C11orf53 involved in chromatin accessibility and maintenance of enhancer-driven transcriptional program in SCLC-P subtype cells.

461	9534498	BODY15	['RESULTS', 'C11ORF53 IS A COACTIVATOR OF POU2F3 IN SCLC CELLS']	RESULTS	As an uncharacterized 288–amino acid protein, there is no obvious functional domain/motif within C11orf53. To study the underlying molecular basis of how C11orf53 is recruited to chromatin and regulates gene expression, we purified green fluorescent protein (GFP)–tagged proteins from SCLC cell line NCI-H526 that stably express either GFP or GFP-tagged C11orf53. By mass spectrometry analysis, we found POU2F3 as one of the top candidates that interacted with C11orf53 (Fig. 5, A and B). We further performed IP experiments with whole-cell lysate from NCI-H526 cells (Fig. 5, C and D) and NCI-H211 cells (fig. S5, A and B) to confirm the protein-protein interaction between the endogenous C11orf53 and POU2F3. To understand how C11orf53 interacts with POU2F3, we truncated POU2F3 into several different truncated fragments (Fig. 5E) and purified each of these GFP-tagged fragments in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells cotransfected with Halo-tagged C11orf53 (Fig. 5F). As shown in Fig. 5G, we found that the POU domain within the POU2F3 protein is critical for the interaction with C11orf53. To determine a potential cofunction between C11orf53 and POU2F3, we conducted ChIP-seq to determine the chromatin occupancy of POU2F3 in NCI-H526 cells. As we expected, there is a significant overlap between POU2F3 and C11orf53 occupancy across the genome in both NCI-H526 [Fig. 5, H (left) and I, and fig. S5F] and NCI-H211 (fig.

463	9534498	BODY17	['RESULTS', 'C11ORF53 IS A COACTIVATOR OF POU2F3 IN SCLC CELLS']	RESULTS	Because C11orf53 protein has no known DNA or histone binding domain, we hypothesized that it may be transported into the nuclei and recruited to chromatin by POU2F3. To test this hypothesis, we transfected HEK293T cells (which express neither POU2F3 nor C11orf53) with Halo-tag or Halo-tagged POU2F3 in the presence of GFP-tagged C11orf53. As shown in fig. S6 (A and B), the chromatin bound C11orf53 was markedly increased in the presence of POU2F3, as determined by Western blot and ChIP-seq results. To confirm this observation in SCLC cells, we depleted POU2F3 by CRISPR knockout in NCI-H526 cells for 2 days and determined the chromatin-bound C11orf53 levels. As shown in fig. S6 (C and D), genetic depletion of POU2F3 could also reduce the chromatin-bound C11orf53, as determined by Western blot and ChIP–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results. These results imply that C11orf53 might function as a coactivator that is recruited to chromatin by POU2F3 (16).
464	9534498	BODY18	['RESULTS', 'C11ORF53 IS A COACTIVATOR OF POU2F3 IN SCLC CELLS']	RESULTS	In NCI-H526 cells, POU2F3 genetic depletion reduced the expression of group 1–clustered genes, which is similar compared to C11orf53 genetic depletion (Fig. 5H, right, and table S6). In total, there are 327 genes that are co–down-regulated by C11orf53 or POU2F3 genetic depletion (fold change >2), in which we have identified numerous tuft cell lineage genes—which has been demonstrated to be targeted genes of POU2F3 (Fig. 5J and fig. S6E). Because the chromatin binding motif between C11orf53 and POU2F3 is extremely similar, we have introduced a luciferase assay to further confirm the cofunction between these two factors. As shown in Fig. 5K, we found that cotransfection of C11orf53 and POU2F3 has the strongest effect on inducing luciferase expression. Similar to C11orf53 genetic depletion, a loss in the expression of POU2F3 also markedly induces apoptosis and reduces cell viability in two different SCLC-P cell lines (Fig. 5, L and M). In summary, our model has shown that this previous uncharacterized protein, C11orf53, functions as a coactivator of POU2F3 and maintains chromatin accessibility at POU2F3-targeted genes in SCLC cells (Fig. 5N).
465	9534498	BODY19	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	The POU family proteins are a large class of DNA binding transcription factors that are divided into six classes, with POU2F3 belonging to the POU II class, which includes POU2F1 (Oct-1) and POU2F2 (Oct-2) (17). As the only known binding partner of POU II class, POU2AF1 (POU Class 2 Homeobox Associating Factor 1) functions as coactivator of POU2F1, and to a lesser extent than POU2F1, as a coactivator of POU2F2 (18–21). Our current study has provided evidence for a previously uncharacterized protein, C11orf53, functioning as a coactivator of POU2F3 (also known as Oct-11). Therefore, we are defining this gene on the basis of its novel function and classifying it as the POU Class 2 Homeobox Associating Factor 2 (or POU2AF2). On the basis of our mass spectrometry analysis of purified C11orf53, we did not detect POU2F1 or POU2F2, which are both expressed in NCI-H526 cells based on our RNA-seq data. This result suggested that C11orf53 is quite a unique coactivator of POU2F3. It is known that POU2AF1 binds to POU2F1 and POU2F2 using its α-helical segment, while C11orf53 does not display a similar structure (22). Therefore, it would be interesting to determine the crystal structure of C11orf53 bounded to POU2F3 but also challenging because of the disordered nature of C11orf53 structure.
466	9534498	BODY20	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	The function of POU2F3 in small cell lung cancer has been identified by genome-wide CRISPR screening in previous studies (12). Therefore, it has been widely used as the biomarker that defines the SCLC-P subtype, which expresses markers of the chemosensory lineage instead of NE markers. Mechanistically, POU2F3 binds to distal enhancer elements and drives the expression of the lineage-specific genes. As a nonhistone/DNA binding coactivator, C11orf53 is recruited to chromatin by the DNA binding transcription factor, POU2F3, and maintains openness of the chromatin to regulate the expression of POU2F3-targeted genes. On the basis of our model (Fig. 5N), C11orf53 may not function as a canonical pioneer factor that recruits transcription factor(s) to chromatin.
467	9534498	BODY21	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	On the basis of our genome-wide RNA-seq analysis in Fig. 5J, there are approximately 32% of C11orf53-targeted genes that are not affected upon POU2F3 genetic depletion, which suggests that C11orf53 may have a POU2F3-independent function. On the basis of our cellular fractionation assay (Fig. 3C and fig. S6C), a significant proportion of C11of53 proteins have been detected in the cytoplasm, while a vast majority of POU2F3 could only be detected in the nuclei. Therefore, future studies may be focused on the cytoplasmic function of C11orf53 in SCLC cells.
468	9534498	BODY22	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Dysregulation or mutations within enhancer binding factors have been identified as direct drivers for many types of cancers (23, 24). Our current studies have shown a critical role of C11orf53 at SEs. Consequently, loss of C11orf53 leads to a loci-specific reduction of H3K27ac levels and gene expression, which is similar to the effects of JQ1 treatment. Our result is consistent with previous reports that SCLC cells are more sensitive to BET inhibitor treatment (11, 25, 26).
469	9534498	BODY23	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	In summary, our study sheds light on the potential impact of targeting C11orf53 or C11orf53/POU2F3 heterodimer for new therapeutic approaches against SCLC-P subtype because of its specificity and high dependency in this particular cancer type, which is in agreement with a recent work published by Vakoc’s group (27).Therefore, establishing small-molecule inhibitors or peptide drugs that can disrupt C11orf53/POU2F3 interaction may specifically inhibit POU2F3-dependent transcriptional programming in SCLC cells and thus aid in the development of a more personalized approach to SCLC therapy.

480	6942053	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	The KDM5A/RBP2 histone demethylase represses NOTCH signaling to sustain neuroendocrine differentiation and promote small cell lung cancer tumorigenesis
481	6942053	ABS0	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	In this study from Oser et al., the authors investigated how RB1 loss causes a neuroendocrine phenotype in different tumor types. They show that histone demethylase KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A) promotes small cell lung cancer (SCLC) proliferation and SCLCs neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype through sustained expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1 by repressing NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes, thereby establishing a role for KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis.
482	6942053	ABS1	['ABSTRACT']	ABSTRACT	More than 90% of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) harbor loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene RB1. The canonical function of the RB1 gene product, pRB, is to repress the E2F transcription factor family, but pRB also functions to regulate cellular differentiation in part through its binding to the histone demethylase KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A). We show that KDM5A promotes SCLC proliferation and SCLC's neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype in part by sustaining expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1. Mechanistically, we found that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation by repressing NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes. To test the role of KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis in vivo, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based mouse model of SCLC by delivering an adenovirus (or an adeno-associated virus [AAV]) that expresses Cre recombinase and sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Tp53, and Rbl2 into the lungs of Lox-Stop-Lox Cas9 mice. Coinclusion of a KDM5A sgRNA decreased SCLC tumorigenesis and metastasis, and the SCLCs that formed despite the absence of KDM5A had higher NOTCH activity compared to KDM5A+/+ SCLCs. This work establishes a role for KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis and suggests that KDM5 inhibitors should be explored as treatments for SCLC.
483	6942053	BODY0	[]	BACKGROUND	Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) are high-grade neuroendocrine tumors that account for ∼15% of lung cancers (Kalemkerian et al. 2013). Almost all SCLCs highly express either ASCL1 (in 70% of cases) or NEUROD1 (in 20% of cases) (Christensen et al. 2014; George et al. 2015; Borromeo et al. 2016), which are both neuronal/neuroendocrine lineage transcription factors (Pattyn et al. 2004; Gao et al. 2009; Chanda et al. 2014). In SCLC, ASCL1 activates genes involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and lung development, as well as known SCLC proto-oncogenes such as MYCL1, NKX2.1, and SOX2 (Borromeo et al. 2016). ASCL1 is required for survival in SCLC cell lines (Augustyn et al. 2014) and for tumor initiation in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC (Borromeo et al. 2016), suggesting that maintenance of the neuroendocrine differentiation state in SCLC is necessary to sustain tumor growth. However, the mechanisms that drive high ASCL1 expression in SCLC are not well understood.
484	6942053	BODY1	[]	BACKGROUND	Approximately 25% of SCLCs have mutually exclusive loss of function (LOF) mutations in NOTCH receptors (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4) (George et al. 2015). Reexpression of the transcriptionally active intracellular domain (ICD) of NOTCH1 (NOTCH1-ICD) or NOTCH2 (NOTCH2-ICD) slows SCLC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibits tumor formation in vivo in a SCLC GEMM (George et al. 2015), demonstrating that NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 function as tumor suppressors in SCLC. Reexpression of NOTCH-ICD also dramatically decreases ASCL1 expression (George et al. 2015), suggesting that low NOTCH activity in SCLC is required to sustain ASCL1 levels and maintain neuroendocrine differentiation. Interestingly, nearly 80% of human SCLCs have transcriptional signatures of low NOTCH activity and express high levels of ASCL1, irrespective of whether they harbor a NOTCH mutation (George et al. 2015). This suggests that other, as yet unknown, mechanisms repress NOTCH activity in SCLC tumors that are genetically NOTCH WT.
485	6942053	BODY2	[]	BACKGROUND	SCLC is almost always linked to inactivating mutations in the RB1 and TP53 tumor suppressor genes. The canonical function of the pRB pathway, which includes pRB and its upstream regulators p16, Cyclin D1, and CDK4, is to regulate cell-cycle progression by modulating E2F-dependent transcription (Dyson 2016). Almost all SCLCs harbor RB1 mutations, whereas CDKN2A (p16), CCND1 (Cyclin D1), and CDK4 mutations are conspicuously rare. This suggests a specific role for pRB loss in SCLC pathogenesis that is not shared by other E2F regulators.
486	6942053	BODY3	[]	BACKGROUND	Rb1 loss in the mouse leads to the development of neuroendocrine pituitary, thyroid, and retinal tumors (Jacks et al. 1992; Zhang et al. 2004). Interestingly, pRB loss in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, and bladder cancer has been linked to transdifferentiation to a small cell neuroendocrine phenotype (Tan et al. 2014; Niederst et al. 2015; Chang 2017; Ku et al. 2017; Mu et al. 2017), suggesting that pRB loss promotes neuroendocrine differentiation.
487	6942053	BODY4	[]	BACKGROUND	In this regard, pRB has been shown to bind and inhibit the activity of the H3K4 histone demethylase KDM5A/RBP2/JARID1A (hereafter referred to as KDM5A), and KDM5A is required for the differentiation block induced by pRB loss (i.e., KDM5A is epistatic to pRB) in cellular models (Benevolenskaya et al. 2005; Lin et al. 2011). Furthermore, loss of KDM5A suppresses the growth of Rb1−/− neuroendocrine pituitary and thyroid tumors (Lin et al. 2011; McBrayer et al. 2018). The role for KDM5A in neuroendocrine differentiation and SCLC tumorigenesis has been largely unexplored, although one study reported that KDM5A shRNAs slowed cellular proliferation in the SCLC cell line NCI-H446 that inherently expresses low levels of ASCL1 (Váraljai et al. 2015).
488	6942053	BODY5	[]	BACKGROUND	Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC have been developed to study SCLC tumorigenesis in vivo. These models have traditionally been generated by intratracheal (IT) injection of adenoviruses encoding Cre recombinase into mice carrying homozygous floxed alleles for Rb1 and Trp53 (referred to hereafter as RP model). In the RP model, SCLCs form after 1 yr (Meuwissen et al. 2003). Some human SCLCs also have mutations in both RB1 and its paralog RBL2 (George et al. 2015), and SCLC tumor latency is reduced to 6 mo in mice when Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 (protein = p130) are inactivated in the lung (referred to hereafter as the RPP model) (Schaffer et al. 2010). However, studying additional genetic interactions in these models is burdensome given the amount of breeding, and hence time, required to introduce additional experimental alleles (e.g., a null allele for a candidate therapeutic target gene or cooperating tumor suppressor gene).
489	6942053	BODY6	[]	BACKGROUND	A mouse strain (hereafter called LSL-Cas9 mice) that conditionally expresses Cas9 after Cre recombinase-mediated excision of a Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) cassette was recently used to make a lung adenocarcinoma GEMM (Platt et al. 2014). These mice developed lung adenocarcinomas ∼2 mo after IT injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding sgRNAs against Trp53, Lkb1, and Kras together with a homologous repair template for introducing an oncogenic K-Ras mutation (Platt et al. 2014). Notably, most of these tumors did not carry a K-Ras mutation and were therefore driven primarily by Trp53 and Lkb1 loss. We reasoned this technology could be used to rapidly inactivate Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 in the mouse to cause SCLC and that, if successful, we could then simultaneously inactivate additional genes that might impact SCLC biology.
490	6942053	BODY7	[]	BACKGROUND	Herein, we show that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC through a NOTCH2-dependent mechanism. We also describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based SCLC GEMM generated by IT injection of an adenovirus that encodes Cre and sgRNAs against Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 into LSL-Cas9 mice. We used this SCLC GEMM to simultaneously deliver a Kdm5a sgRNA at tumor initiation as a means of studying Kdm5a's role in SCLC tumorigenesis.
491	6942053	BODY8	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A PROMOTES SCLC PROLIFERATION IN VITRO']	RESULTS	To ask whether KDM5A promotes SCLC proliferation, we infected three different RB1−/− SCLC cell lines (GLC16, NCI-H82, and NCI-H1876) with lentiviruses that express Cas9 and one of two effective KDM5A sgRNAs (Fig. 1A,C,E). CRISPR-mediated knockdown of KDM5A slowed cellular proliferation in all three cell lines (Fig. 1B,D,F). These effects were likely on target because the proliferation defect in NCI-H82 cells caused by one of the KDM5A sgRNAs was reversed by expression of an sgRNA-resistant KDM5A variant (Fig. 1G,H). Importantly, CRISPR/Cas9 screens performed in 517 cancer cell lines from Project Achilles demonstrated that KDM5A is not a common essential gene and was only found to be a dependency in six of the 558 cell lines examined (Tsherniak et al. 2017). Together, these data show that inactivation of KDM5A inhibits SCLC proliferation in vitro.

493	6942053	BODY10	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A SUSTAINS ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	RB1 loss causes a differentiation block in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and myocytes that is relieved by inactivation of KDM5A. Therefore, RB1 and KDM5A are epistatic with respect to differentiation control (Benevolenskaya et al. 2005). Since almost all SCLCs have loss-of-function RB1 mutations (Peifer et al. 2012; Rudin et al. 2012; George et al. 2015), we hypothesized that KDM5A causes a differentiation block in SCLC. Studies with genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC using cell-type-specific promoters revealed that pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are possibly the cell of origin for most SCLCs (Sutherland et al. 2011). Therefore, we reasoned that a differentiation block in SCLC would manifest as maintenance of its neuroendocrine phenotype, which can be measured by the presence of neuroendocrine markers such as ASCL1, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. To ask whether KDM5A causes a differentiation block in SCLC, we inactivated KDM5A using CRISPR/Cas9 in three different SCLC cell lines that express high levels of ASCL1 (GLC16, NCI-H1417, NCI-H1876). KDM5A inactivation decreased the levels of the neuroendocrine lineage transcriptional activator ASCL1 as well as other neuroendocrine markers (Fig. 2A,B; Supplemental Fig. S1A).

495	6942053	BODY12	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A SUSTAINS ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	We next asked whether pharmacological inhibition of KDM5 demethylase activity repressed ASCL1 levels in three SCLC cell lines (NCI-H69, NCI-H1876, and GLC16). KDM5-C70, a KDM5-family demethylase inhibitor that selectively inhibits KDM5 family members (Johansson et al. 2016) and promotes H3 lysine(K) 4 trimethylation without causing accumulation of other H3 lysine methylation marks (Fig. 2C), markedly decreased ASCL1 levels in all three SCLC cell lines (Fig. 2D–F), and inhibited cellular proliferation in NCI-H1876 and NCI-H69 cells, but not in GLC16 cells (Fig. 2G–I). Strikingly, some NCI-H69 cells, a classic-type SCLC cell line that normally grow purely as suspension cells in aggregates, adhered to tissue-culture plastic after treatment with KDM5-C70 (Fig. 2J), a phenotype that has been correlated with loss of neuroendocrine differentiation in preclinical SCLC models in vitro and in vivo (Calbo et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2017).
496	6942053	BODY13	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A SUSTAINS ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	Both stable and inducible exogenous ASCL1 expression in NCI-H69 cells partially mitigated the antiproliferative effects of KDM5-C70, suggesting that down-regulation of endogenous ASCL1 contributes to the antiproliferative effects of KDM5-C70 (Fig. 2K,L; Supplemental Fig. S1B,C). It should be noted that the exogenous ASCL1 levels we were able to achieve were considerably lower than endogenous ASCL1 levels in NCI-H69 cells (Fig. 2K; Supplemental Fig. S1B). This might account for the incomplete rescue we observed, as would ASCL1-independent activities of KDM5-C70. Further underscoring the importance of ASCL1 with respect to KDM5-C70's antiproliferative effects, ASCL1-positive SCLC subtype cell lines, but not the NEUROD1-positive SCLC subtype cell lines, were more sensitive to KDM5-C70 compared with the NSCLC cell lines examined (Supplemental Fig. S1D–H). Together, these results demonstrate that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels in SCLC to maintain its neuroendocrine phenotype.
497	6942053	BODY14	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 AND NOTCH TARGET GENES TO SUSTAIN ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	KDM5A is a histone demethylase that often functions to repress target genes at transcriptional start sites (Pedersen and Helin 2010). Therefore, we reasoned that KDM5A's ability to sustain ASCL1 levels is likely an indirect effect. To elucidate candidate target genes that are normally repressed by KDM5A to sustain ASCL1 expression, we performed an RNA-sequencing experiment with GLC16 SCLC cells treated with an sgRNA-targeting KDM5A compared with cells treated with a nontargeting sgRNA. Consistent with our data described above (see Fig. 2), ASCL1 was among the 10 most significantly down-regulated mRNAs in the transcriptome in KDM5A knockdown cells (Fig. 3A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of our RNA-sequencing data showed that cells treated with the KDM5A sgRNA had an increased H3K4 trimethylation signature compared with cells treated with nontargeting sgRNA (Fig. 3B), which is consistent with KDM5A's known function as a H3K4me3 histone demethylase. In addition, GSEA revealed that ASCL1 targets were significantly down-regulated and mRNAs that regulate EMT were enriched in KDM5A knockdown cells (Fig. 3B), providing further evidence that KDM5A inactivation causes a loss of neuroendocrine differentiation and a change in cell state.

499	6942053	BODY16	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 AND NOTCH TARGET GENES TO SUSTAIN ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	Interestingly, NOTCH2 was the fourth most up-regulated mRNA in the entire transcriptome of cells lacking KDM5A (Fig. 3A). This was notable because NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 are tumor suppressors in SCLC and repress ASCL1 to inhibit the SCLC neuroendocrine phenotype (George et al. 2015). SCLCs that express ASCL1 have low NOTCH receptor and NOTCH target gene expression irrespective of their NOTCH mutational status (Supplemental Fig. S2A; George et al. 2015). Furthermore, KDM5A interacts with RBP-J and represses the activity of the nuclear NOTCH activation complex (Liefke et al. 2010). We therefore hypothesized that KDM5A represses NOTCH2 and potentially other NOTCH target genes to sustain neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC. Using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR), we confirmed that CRISPR/Cas9 mediated elimination of KDM5A in GLC16 cells increased NOTCH2 and HES1 (a canonical NOTCH target gene) mRNA levels and decreased ASCL1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3C–E). In line with these data, treatment of three different SCLC cell lines (GLC16, NCI-H1876, and NCI-H69 cells) with KDM5-C70 increased HES1 mRNA levels in all three cell lines and increased NOTCH2 expression in GLC16 and NCI-H1876 cells (Fig. 3F–H). We then performed endogenous KDM5A ChIP sequencing experiments in two different SCLC lines (GLC16 and NCI-H1876) to determine whether KDM5A binds the promoters of NOTCH2 and NOTCH2 target genes. We detected binding of KDM5A to the NOTCH2 promoter, canonical NOTCH target genes such as HES1 and HEY1, as well as NOTCH2NL (Supplemental Fig. S3A–D), which is a gene duplication of NOTCH2 that functions to amplify NOTCH2 signaling (Fiddes et al. 2018; Suzuki et al. 2018). The binding of KDM5A to NOTCH2 and NOTCH2NL correlated with increased NOTCH2 and NOTCH2NL mRNA expression in the KDM5A knockout cells (Supplemental Fig. S3E). Together, these results demonstrate that KDM5A represses NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes in SCLC through direct binding.
500	6942053	BODY17	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 AND NOTCH TARGET GENES TO SUSTAIN ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	We next asked whether NOTCH2 overexpression phenocopies KDM5A inactivation in SCLC cell lines. To test this, we infected GLC16 cells, which express low levels of NOTCH2 (Supplemental Fig. S2A), with a lentivirus that expresses transcriptionally active NOTCH2 (N2-ICD) in the presence of doxycycline (DOX-On N2-ICD-FLAG) or with the corresponding empty vector (DOX-On EV) (Supplemental Fig. S2B). We first confirmed that DOX-induced N2-ICD expression induced the canonical NOTCH targets, HES1 and HEY1 (Supplemental Fig. S2D), demonstrating that the exogenous N2-ICD was functional. As has been reported previously (George et al. 2015), enforced expression of N2-ICD slowed cellular proliferation (Supplemental Fig. S2E). Importantly, N2-ICD also decreased ASCL1 mRNA expression and protein levels (Supplemental Fig. S2B,C), thereby recapitulating the effects of KDM5A inactivation.
501	6942053	BODY18	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 AND NOTCH TARGET GENES TO SUSTAIN ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	We next asked whether there were similarities between the transcriptional signatures of SCLC cells that overexpress N2-ICD or lack KDM5A. To answer this, we first performed RNA sequencing in DOX-On N2-ICD cells grown in the presence or absence of DOX and in cells in which KDM5A was or was not inactivated using CRISPR/Cas9. The top 20 target genes induced by N2-ICD (+ DOX compared with −DOX) were comprised of several known NOTCH target genes, including HES and HEY family transcriptional repressors and NRARP, and also some candidate novel NOTCH target genes (Supplemental Fig. S2F). Remarkably, nine of the top 20 genes up-regulated by N2-ICD were also significantly up-regulated upon KDM5A knockdown (Supplemental Fig. S2H).
502	6942053	BODY19	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 AND NOTCH TARGET GENES TO SUSTAIN ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	The top 20 target genes down-regulated by N2-ICD included ASCL1 and the neuroendocrine transcription factor INSM1 (Supplemental Fig. S2G), which is regulated by ASCL1 (Borromeo et al. 2016). Both ASCL1 and INSM1 were also significantly down-regulated in KDM5A knockdown cells (Supplemental Fig. S2I). Together, these data show that there is substantial overlap between the transcriptional signatures of KDM5A inactivation and NOTCH2 overexpression that converge on ASCL1 regulation and neuroendocrine differentiation.
503	6942053	BODY20	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 AND NOTCH TARGET GENES TO SUSTAIN ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	In the simplest model, KDM5A represses NOTCH2 to sustain neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC. To test this directly, we performed an epistasis experiment by inactivating NOTCH2 and KDM5A, alone or in combination, in GLC16 cells using CRISPR/Cas9. A nontargeting sgRNA was used as a control. Consistent with our previous results, inactivating KDM5A alone dramatically decreased ASCL1 levels (Fig. 3I). Strikingly, ASCL1 levels were completely restored in KDM5A knockdown cells where NOTCH2 was also inactivated (Fig. 3I). Furthermore, a γ-secretase inhibitor that blocks NOTCH activation at the plasma membrane also restored ASCL1 levels in cells in which KDM5A was inactivated using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplemental Fig. S1I). Therefore, KDM5A's ability to sustain ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation is NOTCH2-dependent.
504	6942053	BODY21	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 AND NOTCH TARGET GENES TO SUSTAIN ASCL1 LEVELS IN SCLC']	RESULTS	Similar to our findings with KDM5A, LSD1, which demethylates monomethylated H3K4 (Shi et al. 2004), was recently shown to be a dependency in SCLC through its ability to repress NOTCH and sustain ASCL1 (Augert et al. 2019). Given that KDM5A and LSD1 both converge on H3K4 methylation (Shi et al. 2004; Christensen et al. 2007; Klose et al. 2007), we hypothesized that combined inhibition of KDM5A and LSD1 would be synergistic. To test this, we treated NCI-H69 and NCI-H1876 cells with varying concentrations of KDM5-C70 alone, the LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001 alone, or both inhibitors. As previously reported, KDM5-C70 selectively increased H3K4 trimethylation, while ORY-1001 did not (Supplemental Fig. S4A). Combining KDM5-C70 and ORY-1001 at low concentrations synergistically suppressed ASCL1 levels (Supplemental Fig. S4B,E) and cellular proliferation (Supplemental Fig. S4C,D,F,G).
505	6942053	BODY22	['RESULTS', 'A NOVEL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE MODEL OF SCLC DEVELOPED USING CRISPR/CAS9']	RESULTS	To accelerate our ability to study the role of Kdm5a in SCLC tumorigenesis in the RPP GEMM of SCLC, we developed a novel SCLC GEMM using CRISPR/Cas9. To do this we made an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses Cre recombinase and Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 sgRNAs (Fig. 4A) and confirmed that it inactivated these three genes when introduced into Cas9-positive mouse embryonic fibroblasts and inactivated a floxed GFP reporter in cellular assays (Fig. 4B; Supplemental Fig. S5A–D).

507	6942053	BODY24	['RESULTS', 'A NOVEL GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE MODEL OF SCLC DEVELOPED USING CRISPR/CAS9']	RESULTS	We then introduced this AAV (referred to hereafter as RPP AAV) into the lungs of Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL) Cas9 mice by intratracheal (IT) injection and began monitoring the mice by biweekly lung MRIs 8 mo later. The mice began developing tumors about 200 d after IT injection and most were dead within 1 yr (Fig. 4C,E,F). At necropsy, most of these mice had liver metastases and some had kidney/adrenal metastases (Fig. 4D; Supplemental Fig. S5E), both consistent with the behavior of human SCLC and mouse SCLC GEMMs (Kalemkerian et al. 2013; Gazdar et al. 2015). Seven out of eight mice that developed lung tumors had histology consistent with SCLC (the eighth had mixed histology more suggestive of lung adenocarcinoma) and expressed the neuroendocrine markers Ascl1 and Synaptophysin (Fig. 4D; Supplemental Fig. S5E) and, when examined, harbored loss-of-function insertion/deletions at the expected CRISPR/Cas9 cut sites for the Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 sgRNAs (Supplemental Fig. S5F,G). Interestingly, >90% of the CRISPR amplicon sequencing reads for Rb1 and Trp53 within each tumor revealed single base pair, presumably loss-of-function insertions, consistent with strong positive selection of these insertions in founder clones (Supplemental Fig. S5F). Therefore CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to generate SCLC through somatic gene editing of Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 in mice.
508	6942053	BODY25	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A PROMOTES SCLC TUMORIGENESIS AND METASTASIS IN VIVO']	RESULTS	To study the role of Kdm5a in SCLC tumorigenesis, we next generated adenoviruses that encoded Cre and sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 together with an sgRNA targeting Kdm5a (referred to hereafter as sgKdm5a RPP) or a nontargeting control sgRNA (referred to hereafter as sgControl RPP) (Fig. 5A,B; Supplemental Fig. S6A). We switched from AAV to adenovirus because IT administration of Cre to make SCLC GEMMs has traditionally been accomplished with adenoviruses (Meuwissen et al. 2003) and because we observed, upon treating additional mice, that ∼25% of mice administered the RPP AAV developed pulmonary histiocytic sarcomas.

For all experiments, data are represented as ±SEM.
510	6942053	BODY27	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A PROMOTES SCLC TUMORIGENESIS AND METASTASIS IN VIVO']	RESULTS	We then introduced either the sgKdm5a RPP or sgControl RPP adenovirus into the lungs of LSL-Cas9 mice and began monitoring the mice by monthly MRI 6 mo later. Tumors developed with a longer latency (Fig. 5D), and grew more slowly (Fig. 5C,E–G; Supplemental Figs. S6B,C), in the sgKdm5A RPP mice compared with the sgControl RPP mice. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in metastasis in sgKdm5a RPP mice compared with sgControl RPP mice (Fig. 5H; Supplemental Fig. S6F). These biological differences were associated with an increase in median overall survival in sgKdm5a RPP mice compared with sgControl RPP mice (Fig. 5I). At necropsy, >90% of tumors formed in both sgKdm5a RPP mice and sgControl RPP mice were SCLC based on histological analysis after staining with hematoxylin and eosin and antibodies against the neuroendocrine markers Ascl1, Synaptophysin, and Chromogranin A (Supplemental Figs. S6D,E, S7A,B). CRISPR amplicon sequencing of tumors for Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 showed that all three genes were completely inactivated in SCLCs formed in both sgKdm5a RPP mice and sgControl RPP mice (Supplemental Fig. S6G). Collectively, this shows that Kdm5a promotes SCLC tumorigenesis and metastasis.
511	6942053	BODY28	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 IN SCLC IN VIVO']	RESULTS	Given that Kdm5a promotes SCLC tumorigenesis (Fig. 5), we then asked how tumors were able to form in mice that were injected with the sgKdm5a RPP adenovirus. One possibility was that these tumors selected for functional Kdm5a (either nonedited Kdm5a or in-frame insertions/deletions of Kdm5a). Surprisingly, CRISPR amplicon sequencing of the tumors that formed despite the Kdm5a sgRNA revealed that the sgRNA target site for Kdm5a contained an insertion that would lead to a premature stop codon (Supplemental Fig. S7C,D) at an allelic frequency concordant with insertion/deletions found in Rb1 and Trp53 in 11/11 SCLC tumors examined. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Kdm5a confirmed loss of protein expression of Kdm5a in mice treated with sgKdm5a RPP (Supplemental Fig. S7A,B). There were no global changes in trimethylation of H3K4 levels in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Supplemental Fig. S8A,B). Lastly, mRNA expression of other Kdm5 family paralogs (Kdm5b, Kdm5c, and Kdm5d) was similar in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Supplemental Fig. S8C). Together, the mutational and immunohistochemical analyses of KDM5A demonstrate that Kdm5a was successfully inactivated in the tumors arising in the sgKdm5A RPP mice. Conceivably, these tumors underwent genetic or epigenetic changes that rendered them Kdm5a-independent.
512	6942053	BODY29	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 IN SCLC IN VIVO']	RESULTS	Our mouse model allowed us to ask whether Kdm5a also represses Notch2 levels in vivo as it does in cell culture. We first developed and validated IHC assays for Notch2 and Notch1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts in which we had deleted Notch2 or Notch1 using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplemental Fig. S9A,B). Consistent with our in vitro studies, the percentage of Notch2-positive tumor cells by IHC in sgKdm5a RPP tumors was increased compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6A,B; Supplemental Fig. S9C,D). To corroborate these findings, we also isolated cell lines from sgKdm5a RPP and sgControl RPP tumors using two independent methods (see Materials and Methods) (Liu et al. 2017). Cell lines derived from sgKDM5a RPP tumors had increased levels of Notch2 and decreased levels of the neuroendocrine markers Ascl1 and Synaptophysin compared with the cell lines derived from sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6D; Supplemental Fig. S10A). Interestingly, cells lines generated from the sgKdm5a RPP tumors were more adherent than cell lines generated from the sgControl RPP tumors (Supplemental Fig. S10B,C), a phenotype that has been correlated with a non-neuroendocrine phenotype (Calbo et al. 2011; Lim et al. 2017).

514	6942053	BODY31	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 IN SCLC IN VIVO']	RESULTS	To better understand the global transcriptional changes caused by Kdm5a inactivation in SCLC tumors, we performed RNA sequencing and GSEA comparing sgKdm5a RPP tumors and sgControl RPP tumors. Consistent with our in vitro data (Fig. 3) and in vivo data (Fig. 6A,B), GSEA showed significantly increased NOTCH signaling in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6C). Several gene sets associated with differentiation/cell state changes were also up-regulated in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with control tumors, including an epithelial mesenchymal transition gene set (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, K-Ras signaling was also up-regulated in sgKdm5a RPP tumors (Fig. 6C), which might circumvent the growth inhibitory effects of Kdm5a loss and, like Kdm5a loss, decreases neuroendocrine markers in SCLC cell lines (Calbo et al. 2011).
515	6942053	BODY32	['RESULTS', 'KDM5A REPRESSES NOTCH2 IN SCLC IN VIVO']	RESULTS	Interestingly, our RNA sequencing data showed that Dlk1, a Notch inhibitory ligand that is highly expressed in many human SCLC tumors (George et al. 2015), was the fourth most significantly up-regulated gene in sgKdm5a RPP tumors compared with sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6E). We validated our RNA sequencing results using RT-qPCR for Nell1 (the most up-regulated gene in sgKdm5a RPP tumors) and Dlk1 in the sgKdm5a RPP and sgControl RPP tumors (Fig. 6F,G). Notch signaling suppresses SCLC and, as shown here, is up-regulated in cells lacking Kdm5a. Up-regulation of Dlk1 might serve to mitigate the tumor-suppressive effect of Notch (George et al. 2015) pursuant to Kdm5a loss.
516	6942053	BODY33	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	We show that the H3K4 demethylase KDM5A represses NOTCH2 and thereby sustains ASCL1 expression in SCLC. ASCL1 transcriptionally activates genes that promote neuroendocrine differentiation and SCLC tumorigenesis, and genetic loss of ASCL1 inhibits SCLC tumorigenesis in a genetically engineered mouse model of SCLC (Borromeo et al. 2016). Consistent with these observations, we observed that loss of KDM5A retards the development and growth of mouse SCLCs and that KDM5A-defective mouse SCLCs exhibit increased NOTCH2, increased NOTCH signaling, decreased ASCL1, and decreased neuroendocrine differentiation relative to their KDM5A-proficient counterparts.
517	6942053	BODY34	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 are bona fide SCLCs tumor suppressor genes, but many SCLCs that lack NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 mutations nonetheless have impaired NOTCH activity (George et al. 2015). Our findings suggest that RB1 loss and deregulation of KDM5A suffices to at least partially inhibit NOTCH activity. The subsequent inactivation of NOTCH1 or NOTCH2 would conceivably attenuate NOTCH signaling even further. We note that NOTCH1 mutations are more common than NOTCH2 mutations in SCLC (George et al. 2015). RB1 loss and deregulation of KDM5A partially down-regulates NOTCH2 and spares NOTCH1, which would increase the selection pressure to inactivate NOTCH1.
518	6942053	BODY35	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	H3K4 methylation has been linked to NOTCH signaling previously (Moshkin et al. 2009; Liefke et al. 2010; Di Stefano et al. 2011). H3K4 trimethylation near transcription start sites typically enhances transcription, while monomethylated H3K4 often marks transcriptional enhancers (Beshiri et al. 2012; Whyte et al. 2012). KDM5 family members and KDM1A (LSD1) demethylate methylated H3K4, with the former uniquely capable of demethylating trimethylated H3K4 (Shi et al. 2004; Christensen et al. 2007; Klose et al. 2007). In model organisms, KDM5A and LSD1 cooperate to directly repress NOTCH target genes through local erasure of H3K4 methylation marks (Di Stefano et al. 2011). KDM5A can be recruited to DNA via histone chaperone proteins or via RBP-J, which is a core component of the NOTCH DNA-binding transcriptional complex (Moshkin et al. 2009; Liefke et al. 2010). LSD1 forms a complex with SIRT1 that also represses NOTCH target gene expression (Mulligan et al. 2011). Our findings suggest that KDM5A also represses NOTCH2 itself. Importantly, we showed that KDM5A and NOTCH2 are epistatic to one another with respect to control of ASCL1 and neuroendocrine differentiation.
519	6942053	BODY36	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Retinoblastomas and SCLCs are, numerically, the most common tumors linked to germline and somatic RB1 mutations, respectively. These tumors, like the pituitary and thyroid tumors that develop in Rb1+/− mice, express neuroendocrine markers. This intimate relationship between RB1 inactivation and neuroendocrine tumors suggests that neuroendocrine cells are especially permissive for transformation after RB1 loss, that RB1 loss causes cells to maintain or adopt neuroendocrine features (Park et al. 2018), or perhaps both. In this regard, RB1 loss has been linked to acquired drug resistance and neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of epithelial cancers (Tan et al. 2014; Niederst et al. 2015; Chang 2017; Ku et al. 2017; Mu et al. 2017), supporting that RB1 loss causes expression of neuroendocrine markers. Our findings suggest that RB1 loss, and subsequent deregulation of the pRB-binding protein KDM5A, represses NOTCH signaling, increases ASCL1 levels, and thereby increases neuroendocrine differentiation.
520	6942053	BODY37	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	ASCL1 appears to be a lineage addiction oncogene in SCLC, but the ASCL1 protein would classically be viewed as undruggable. However, targeting mechanisms that indirectly promote ASCL1 activity, such as inhibiting proteins that normally function to increase ASCL1 mRNA expression, could indirectly inhibit ASCL1. Using both genetic and pharmacological tools, we showed that inhibiting KDM5A decreases ASCL1 expression in SCLC cell lines, suggesting that KDM5A inhibition could be used as a therapeutic strategy to target ASCL1. Notably, Kdm5a is a nonessential gene in mice and Kdm5a inactivation in mice decreases Rb1−/− neuroendocrine tumors in both prevention and treatment models (Lin et al. 2011; McBrayer et al. 2018). A caveat with our study is that the pharmacological inhibitor we used, KDM5-C70, is selective for KDM5 demethylases, but inhibits all four KDM5 family members at nearly equivalent IC50 values (Johansson et al. 2016). It is also notable that the antitumor effects that we observed upon genetically ablating Kdm5a in our mouse model, though reproducible, were relatively modest. We suspect that this reflects the fact that Kdm5a was inactivated at or near the time of initiation, coupled with strong selective pressure for escape mechanisms when an oncogene is inactivated. Indeed, we observed similar effect sizes when we eliminated the SCLC oncoprotein Ascl1 instead of Kdm5a in our mouse model (MG Oser and WG Kaelin, unpubl.). We imagine that the effects of inactivating Kdm5a might have been greater had we acutely inactivated it in established tumors.
521	6942053	BODY38	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Our preclinical data suggests that combining a KDM5 inhibitor with an LSD1 inhibitor would synergistically suppress ASCL1, which could result in increased efficacy compared with treatment with a KDM5 inhibitor or LSD1 inhibitor alone. Notably, SCLCs are selectively sensitive to an LSD1 inhibitor compared with other adult solid tumors (Mohammad et al. 2015). A recent study demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 had striking efficacy in some patient-derived SCLC xenograft models (Augert et al. 2019), which was associated with activation of NOTCH signaling and repression of ASCL1. Our findings provide a further rationale for developing drugs that specifically inhibit KDM5A and for testing them in preclinical SCLC models alone or in combination with LSD1 inhibitors.
522	6942053	BODY39	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	We developed a new SCLC GEMM using CRISPR/Cas9 to simultaneously inactivate Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 in the lung. We also showed that this method can be used to rapidly ask whether inactivating a fourth gene (in our case, Kdm5a) can alter the natural history of SCLC. Therefore, this model can be used to interrogate candidate oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, or therapeutic targets without the need for complex and time-consuming breeding strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first SCLC GEMM developed on a pure congenic background, which allows cell lines established from this model to be used for syngeneic transplant studies. Our model is well suited to study response and resistance of SCLC to immunotherapies, which is timely, since the PD-L1 checkpoint blockade antibody Atezolizomab has recently been shown to improve survival when given with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for SCLC patients (Horn et al. 2018). Furthermore, cell lines derived from our SCLC GEMM stably express Cas9 and therefore could be used directly to perform CRISPR/Cas9 screens to nominate potential SCLC oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, or genes that modulate response or resistance to targeted therapy or immunotherapy.

Briefly, GLC16 cells were plated at 0.2 × 106 cells/mL in 20 mL of complete media. NCI-H1876 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/mL in 20 mL of complete media. Forty-eight hours after plating, media was removed by aspiration and the cells were washed once in PBS at room temperature. The cells were then cross-linked by incubation with 2 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) with rocking for 30 min at room temperature. The DSG was removed and the cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS for 10 min at 37°C. Excess formaldehyde was quenched by dropwise addition of Glycine to a final concentration 125 mM. The cells were then rocked for an additional 5 min at room temperature. The paraformaldehyde/glycine was then removed and the cells were washed once with ice cold PBS. A total of 5 mL of ice-cold PBS was added to the cells and the cells were removed by scraping.
552	6942053	BODY69	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CHIP SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS']	METHODS	The cells were centrifuged at 3000g for 5 min and resuspended in 3 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 8, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% TX-100 supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated while rotating for 10 min at 4°C. Intact nuclei were then collected by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then gently aspirated and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated while rotating for 10 min at 4°C. The nuclei were again collected by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then aspirated and the tube was rinsed with 0.5 mL of shearing buffer (0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitors). The nuclei were again collected by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4500 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was carefully removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL shearing buffer and transferred to a 1 mL AFA tube (Covaris #520130).
553	6942053	BODY70	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CHIP SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS']	METHODS	The chromatin was then sonicated using a Covaris E220 sonicator at 100 peak incident power, 10% duty cycles, 200 cycles per burst, water level 8 for 900 sec. The samples were then transferred to 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. 0.9 mL of the supernatants were transferred to a new Eppendorf tube, to which was added TX-100 (final concentration of 1%) and NaCl (final concentration of 150 mM).
554	6942053	BODY71	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CHIP SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS']	METHODS	A total of 20 µL of Dynabeads Protein G (ThermoFisher #10004D) was then added and samples were rotated for 1 h at 4°C. The Dynabeads were then removed using a magnetic stand and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes. Five percent of the total was removed to be used as the input. One microgram of rabbit polyclonal anti-KDM5A antibody (Abcam, #ab70892) was added and the samples were incubated overnight while rotating at 4°C. The following morning, A total of 50 µL of Dynabeads Protein G were added and the samples were incubated for another 2 h while rotating at 4°C. A magnetic stand was used to pellet the Dynabeads. The supernatant was removed and the Dynabeads were washed once in 1 mL of low-salt immune complex wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% TX-100, 2 mM EDTA) and incubated for 5 min while rotating at 4°C. The beads were again pelleted using a magnetic stand. Following removal of the supernatant, the Dynabeads were washed once in 1 mL of high-salt immune complex wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% TX-100, 2 mM EDTA) and incubated for 5 min while rotating at 4°C. The beads were again pelleted with a magnetic stand. Following removal of the supernatant the Dynabeads were washed once in 1 mL of Lithium Chloride wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA) and incubated for 5 min while rotating at 4°C. The beads were then washed twice in TE (pH 8) at room temperature and the beads were then resuspended in 100 µL TE (pH 8).
555	6942053	BODY72	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CHIP SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS']	METHODS	RNase A was then added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37°C. To reverse the crosslinking, proteinase K was then added to a final concentration of 0.8 mg/mL and the samples were incubated for 30 min at 42°C and then an additional 8 h at 65°C. A total of 300 µL QG buffer and 100 µL of isopropanol was then added to each sample and a magnetic stand was used to pellet the Dynabeads. The supernatant was then collected and DNA was isolated using QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
556	6942053	BODY73	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CHIP SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS']	METHODS	Recovered DNA was quantified by Qubit and sequencing libraries were prepared using the Rubicon Genomics Thruplex-DNAseq sample preparation kits from 2 ng of the immunoprecipitated DNA according to manufacturer's protocol. The resultant ChIPseq libraries were quantified by Qubit fluorometer, Agilent TapeStation 2200, and RT-qPCR using the Kapa Biosystems library quantification kit according to manufacturer's protocols. Uniquely indexed libraries were pooled in equimolar ratios and sequenced on a single Illumina NextSeq500 run with single-end 75-bp reads by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Molecular Biology Core Facilities.
557	6942053	BODY74	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'CHIP SEQUENCING AND ANALYSIS']	METHODS	ChIP-seq reads generated from KDM5A libraries were aligned to the Human genome (hg19) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin 2010). KDM5A ChIP and Input tag densities were calculated using the R package SPP (Kharchenko et al. 2008) with a Gaussian kernel bandwidth of 35 bp. Enrichment of KDM5A relative to input was determined and peaks were called using the SPP function “get.broad.enrichment.clusters” with a Z-score threshold of three and a window size of 1000 bp. Files in BigWig format were generated for both tag enrichment and tag density for visualization in the genome browser. Reference transcript annotations for the human genome were obtained from the University of California Santa Cruz Genomics Institute (UCSC) (Casper et al. 2018). Each transcription start site (TSS) was categorized as KDM5A positive in GLC16 and/or NCI-H1876 cell lines if an overlapping KDM5A peak was encompassing the TSS in both KDM5A ChIP-seq replicates of the corresponding cell line. Peaks at TSSs were then compared with expression data from GLC16 cells that were either treated with a KDM5A sgRNA or with a control sgRNA. Expression estimates were produced with the VIPER package (Cornwell et al. 2018). Genes with a significant increase in expression (log2 fold-change cutoff ≥1.5 and an adjusted P-value <0.05) were reported.
558	6942053	BODY75	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ADENOVIRAL AND ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRAL (AAV) SGRNA EXPRESSION VECTORS']	METHODS	Effective sgRNAs targeting mouse Kdm5a, Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 were first validated using lentiviral vectors (see Supplemental Figs. 5,6). To generate the AAV vector depicted in Figure 4A, we first generated a destination vector (pAAVGao-DEST-EFS-Cre-2A-Fluc-spA). This was accomplished by inserting a multiple cloning site sequence (TCTAGAACCGGTAGATCTATCGATAAGCTTGGTACCCTCGAGTTAATTAAGGATCCGCTAGCGCGGCCGC) between XbaI and NotI in pX551 (a gift from Feng Zhang [Addgene # 60957]), which replaced the original sequence in the pX551 vector. We then inserted the universal gateway cassette between PacI and NheI using restriction enzymes to generate an intermediate vector named pAAVGao-DEST. Next we performed overlapping PCR to assemble the EFS promoter, Cre and 2A-Fluc-short poly(A) signal that contained a 5′ PacI site and 3′ XbaI site. The PCR product was digested with PacI and XbaI and ligated into pAAVGao-DEST cut with these two enzymes.
559	6942053	BODY76	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ADENOVIRAL AND ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRAL (AAV) SGRNA EXPRESSION VECTORS']	METHODS	Next we performed Gibson assembly to generate an entry vector (pENTR223-sgRb1-sgTp53-sgRbl2) containing sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2. pENTR223-sgRb1-sgTp53-sgRbl2 was then mixed with pAAVGao-DEST-EFS-Cre-2A-Fluc-spA to make the final pAAVGao-sgRb1-sgTp53-sgRbl2-EFS-Cre-2A-Fluc-spA by homologous recombination reaction using LR Clonase II (Life Technologies #11791100) at 25°C for 1 h per the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixtures were then transformed at a ratio of 1:10 (volume recombination reaction:volume competent cells) into HB101 cells and ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened by restriction digestion of miniprep DNA and subsequently validated by DNA sequencing.
560	6942053	BODY77	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ADENOVIRAL AND ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRAL (AAV) SGRNA EXPRESSION VECTORS']	METHODS	To generate the adenoviruses depicted in Figure 5A, Gibson assembly was performed to generate an entry vector that encoded CMV-Cre recombinase and sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 and either an sgRNA targeting Kdm5a (pENTR223-CMV-Cre-sgKdm5a-sgRb1-sgTp53-sgRbl2) or a nontargeting sgRNA (sgControl) (pENTR223-CMV-Cre-sgC0111-sgRb1-sgTp53-sgRbl2). Gateway cloning was performed to clone the cassettes above into pAd-PL DEST (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinants were transformed into HB101 cells and ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened by restriction digestion of miniprep DNA and subsequently validated by DNA sequencing.
561	6942053	BODY78	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS (AAV) PRODUCTION']	METHODS	293FT cells were counted using a Vi-Cell XR Cell Counter (Beckman Coulter) and 1 × 107 cells were plated using DMEM media containing FBS without penicillin and streptomycin on a 15-cm tissue-culture dish. The following day, the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with the AAV vector along with AAV-DJ and AAV-pHelper packaging vectors (Cell Biolabs) at a ratio of 1:1:1. The next day, fresh DMEM media with 10% FBS was added; 48 h later, the cells and media were collected and subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles by alternating between an ethanol dry ice bath and 37°C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was collected, passed through a 0.45-µm filter, aliquoted, and frozen at −80°C until use.
562	6942053	BODY79	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ADENO-ASSOCIATED VIRUS (AAV) PRODUCTION']	METHODS	To generate high-titer AAV for in vivo experiments, AAV was generated as described above, but 10 15-cm tissue-culture dishes of 293FT cells were transfected with AAV, and all transfected cells were pooled when the virus was harvested. AAV virus was purified using Virabind AAV Purification Megakit (Cell Biolabs #VPK141) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AAV virus was titered using QuickTiter AAV Quantitation Kit (Cell Biolabs ##VPK145) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
563	6942053	BODY80	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ADENOVIRUS PRODUCTION']	METHODS	A total of 5 µg of the adenovirus vector (pAd/PL Invitrogen #V494-20) containing the desired sgRNA sequences and Cre recombinase expression cassette (see Cloning Methods) was digested with PacI (New England Biolabs) for 2 h at 37°C according to the manufacturer's instructions and column purified using Qiagen's gel extraction kit. One microgram of PacI-digested pAd/PL was transfected into 1.5 × 106 293AD cells plated on a 6-cm tissue-culture dish using Lipofectamine 2000. The following day, the media was exchanged, and subsequently every 48 h thereafter. Once 293AD cells showed evidence of adenovirus production (determined by comet formation with lysis), the cells and supernatant were harvested, which were then subjected to four freeze–thaw cycles by alternating between an ethanol dry ice bath and 37°C. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was collected, passed through a 0.45-µm filter, aliquoted, and frozen at −80°C until use.
564	6942053	BODY81	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'ADENOVIRUS PRODUCTION']	METHODS	To generate high-titer adenovirus for in vivo experiments, adenovirus was generated as described above. One hundred microliters of the adenovirus stock was added to each 10-cm tissue-culture dish of 293FT cells plated at 3 × 106 cells per dish (four 10-cm dishes in total for each purification). When 293FT cells showed evidence of adenovirus production, as determined by cell rounding and partial detachment (∼48–72 h after addition of adenoviral stock), the cells were collected and adenovirus was purified using Virabind Adenovirus Purification Kit (VPK-100). The purified adenovirus was then dialyzed into PBS at 4°C overnight. Adenovirus was titered using QuickTiter Adenovirus Quantitation Kit (Cell Biolabs ##VPK106) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
565	6942053	BODY82	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'MOUSE EXPERIMENTS']	METHODS	All mouse experiments complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Animal Care and Use Committee (DFCI, protocol 03-105).
566	6942053	BODY83	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'INTRATRACHEAL INJECTIONS']	METHODS	Intratracheal injections were performed as described previously (DuPage et al. 2009). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and pedal reflexes were monitored to ensure adequate anesthesia. Mice were maintained on a heated stage at 37°C while anesthetized. Mice were hung on stage with their top incisors and intubated with a 22-gauge 1-inch catheter (ThermoFisher Scientific #1484120). Once intubated, adenovirus (4 × 108 VP/mouse) or AAV (1 × 1011 GC/mouse) in a total volume of 75 µL (diluted in PBS) was added to the catheter and subsequently inhaled by the mice.
567	6942053	BODY84	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'GENERATION OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE MODELS OF SCLC USING CRISPR/CAS9']	METHODS	For the AAV experiments in Figure 4, 2–3-mo-old transgenic lox-stop-lox Cas9 mice (a kind gift from Feng Zhang now deposited at Jackson Laboratories [Jackson No. 026556]) were intratracheally injected with an AAV (1 × 1011 GC/mouse) encoding effective sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 and Cre recombinase and firefly luciferase. MRI's of the lungs were performed beginning ∼8 mo after intratracheal injection and performed every 2-wk thereafter until the mice were euthanized.
568	6942053	BODY85	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'GENERATION OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE MODELS OF SCLC USING CRISPR/CAS9']	METHODS	For the adenovirus experiments in Figures 5 and 6, 2–3-mo-old transgenic Lox-stop-Lox Cas9 mice (a kind gift from Monte Winslow now deposited at Jackson Laboratories [Jackson No. 026816]) were intratracheally injected with adenovirus (4 × 108 VP/mouse) encoding effective sgRNAs targeting Rb1, Trp53, and Rbl2 and Cre recombinase that also encoded either an effective sgRNA targeting Kdm5a (sgKdm5a RPP) or a nontargeting sgRNA as a control (sgControl RPP). MRIs of the lungs were performed on mice beginning 8 mo after intratracheal injection and were performed monthly thereafter until the mice became symptomatic and were euthanized. Tumor volumes were calculated by lung MRIs (see Mouse MRI Imaging Methods). Tumor doubling times were calculated based on the tumor volume measurements.
569	6942053	BODY86	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'GENERATION OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE MODELS OF SCLC USING CRISPR/CAS9']	METHODS	Mice were euthanized when they became symptomatic (primarily respiratory distress), moribund, or lost 15% of their total body weight. (All mice injected with adenovirus were included in the final analysis except for two mice [#188 and #189]. These two mice died after the first MRI imaging session, likely related to anesthesia, and did not have tumors by MRI or necropsy.) Half of the lung tumor specimen was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent DNA and RNA analysis, while the other half was fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and then stored in 70% ethanol. Liver and kidney/adrenals were also harvested and fixed in formalin as above to determine whether metastasis occurred. The tissues were then embedded in paraffin. Slides were made for hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and analyzed by a pathologist.
570	6942053	BODY87	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'MOUSE MRI IMAGING']	METHODS	MRI experiments were performed on a Bruker BioSpec 7T/30-cm USR horizontal bore Superconducting Magnet System (Bruker Corp.) equipped with the B-GA12S2 gradient and integrated with a second-order room-temperature shim system, which provides a maximum gradient amplitude of 440 mT/m and slew rate of 3440 T/m/s. The Bruker-made 23-mm ID birdcage volume radiofrequency (RF) coil was used for both RF excitation and receiving. The Bruker AutoPac with laser positioning was used for accurate definition of the region of interest. Animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane mixed in medical air at a flow rate of 2 L/min. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a warm air fan. A pressure-transducer for respiratory gating was placed on the abdomen. Animal respiration and temperature were monitored and regulated by the SAII (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY) monitoring and gating system model 1025T. Bruker Paravision 6.0.1 was used for MRI data acquisition. T2 weighted images of the lungs were obtained using a fast spin echo (RARE) with fat suppression sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1773 ms, TE = 36 ms, Rare Factor = 8, Number of Averages = 8, total acquisition time 4 min 40 sec, FOV = 24 × 24 mm2, matrix size = 192 × 256, spatial resolution = 125 × 117 µm2, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, number of slices = 20, and a total acquisition time of 7:30 min. Images were analyzed with the semi-automatic segmentation analysis software ClinicalVolumes (ClinicalVolumes, London, UK). A region of interest (ROI) delineating the tumor lesion was defined on each slice, and the total tumor volume was computed as the sum of all the ROI-defined areas.

Slides were baked in an Isotemp Oven (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 60°C to melt excess paraffin. Immunohistochemistry staining for KDM5A was performed on a Bond III (Leica Biosystems, Buffalo Grove, IL) using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (DS9800; Leica Biosystems). Antigen retrieval was performed on the Bond III for 30 min using Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (EDTA, pH = 9.0). Slides were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-KDM5A antibody (Abcam cat. no. ab194286, 1:500) diluted in Bond Primary Antibody Diluent (Leica Biosystems cat. no. AR9352) for 30 min, before incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 10 min. Staining was visualized by incubation with the chromogen 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for 5 min. Finally, slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in graded ethanol and xylene, and cover slips were applied.
573	6942053	BODY90	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC)']	METHODS	Immunohistochemical staining for H3K4me3, Ascl1, Synaptophysin, Chromogranin A, Notch1, and Notch2 was performed by hand. As above, 4-micron-thick paraffin-embedded tissue sections were prepared on glass slides and left to air-dry overnight. Slides were baked in an Isotemp Oven (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) at 60°C for 30 min before staining. For antigen retrieval, slides were heated with a DC2002 Decloaking Chamber (Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA) to 125°C for 30 sec and 90°C for 10 sec in EDTA buffer (pH = 8, Thermo Scientific cat. no.

All sections were incubated with peroxidase (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and protein (Dako) blocking reagents for 5 min each. Sections were then incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-Synaptophysin antibody (Abcam cat. no. ab32127; 1:5500), rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K4me3 antibody (Cell Signaling cat. no. 9751; 1:5000) rabbit polyclonal anti-Chromogranin A antibody (Abcam cat. no. ab15160; 1:300), rabbit monoclonal anti-Notch1 antibody (Cell Signaling cat. no. 3608; 1:100), rabbit monoclonal anti-Notch2 antibody (Cell Signaling cat. no. 5732; 1:100), or rabbit monoclonal anti-Ascl1 antibody (Abcam cat. no. ab211327; 1:100) diluted in Dako Diluent with Background Reducing Components (Dako) for 60 min at room temperature. Following primary incubation, sections were incubated with Envision + System-HRP Labeled Polymer Anti-Rabbit (Dako cat. no. K4003) for 30 min. All sections were developed using the DAB chromogen kit (Dako K3468) and counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in graded ethanol and xylene, mounted, and coverslipped.
574	6942053	BODY91	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC)']	METHODS	To establish specificity of the IHC assay for Notch1, and Notch2, we compared MEFs expressing Cas9 that were infected with two effective sgRNAs (that we previously validated by immunoblot analysis) targeting Notch1 (sg1 and sg5) or Notch2 (sg1 and sg2) or a nontargeting sgRNA used as a control.
575	6942053	BODY92	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC)']	METHODS	Notch1, Notch2, and H3K4me3 stained slides were digitized using the Scanscope XT (Aperio Technologies Inc., Visa, CA) and analyzed using the Indica Lab Halo platform. Slides were annotated and nuclear staining was quantified using Indica Labs-Multiplex IHC v1.2algorithm. The percentage of Notch1, Notch2, and H3K4me3 positivity in tumor cells was then calculated. The level of H3K4me3 expression was quantified using a 0 to 3+ scale based on the optical density of the nuclear staining in each cell.
576	6942053	BODY93	['MATERIALS AND METHODS', 'GENERATION OF CELL LINES FROM MOUSE SCLC TUMORS']	METHODS	To generate cell lines from tumors using 3T3-J2 murine fibroblasts (Liu et al. 2017), 3T3-J2 murine fibroblasts that had been irradiated and confirmed to be senescent were plated in the morning in complete Schlegal media (DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS, Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (Life Technologies #41400045), 0.125 µg/mL EGF, 5 µM Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, Sigma #SCM075), 25 µg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma H0135), 11.7 µM Cholera toxin (Sigma #C-1032), 250 µg/mL fungizone (Fisher Scientific #BP264550), and 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The irradiated 3T3-J2 murine fibroblasts were allowed to adhere for at least 2 h. LSL-Cas9 mice (Jackson No. 026816) that were injected with sgKdm5a RPP or sgControl RPP adenovirus that had lung tumors confirmed by MRI and were symptomatic were euthanized with CO2 and their tumors were quickly extracted, washed in ice cold PBS, and minced several times using an ethanol-sterilized razor blade. A total of 3 mL of collagenase/hyaluronidase (Stem cell biology #07912) diluted 1:10 in DMEM/F12 media and 1 mL dispase (Corning # 354235) was added to the tumor, and incubated at 37°C for 20–40 min (until most tumor cells were in suspension). The cells were then collected, centrifuged at 1000 rpm (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810R) for 5 min, resuspended in complete Schlegal media, filtered through a 70-µm cell strainer (BD #352350), centrifuged again at 1000 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in fresh complete Schlegal media and placed on tissue culture dishes containing irradiated 3T3-J2 murine fibroblasts. Media was subsequently replaced every 3 d and fresh irradiated 3T3-J2 murine fibroblasts were used for every passage (∼5–7 d).

584	9619308	ABS0	['SUMMARY']	ABSTRACT	DNA methylation is a key regulator of gene expression and a clinical therapeutic predictor. We examined global DNA methylation beyond the generally used promoter areas in human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and find that gene body methylation is a robust positive predictor of gene expression. Combining promoter and gene body methylation better predicts gene expression than promoter methylation alone including genes involved in the neuroendocrine classification of SCLC and the expression of therapeutically relevant genes including MGMT, SLFN11, and DLL3. Importantly, for super-enhancer (SE) covered genes such as NEUROD1 or MYC, using H3K27ac and NEUROD1, ASCL1, and POU2F3 ChIP-seq data, we show that genic methylation is inversely proportional to expression, thus providing a new approach to identify potential SE regulated genes involved in SCLC pathogenesis. To advance SCLC transitional research, these data are integrated into our web portal (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/) for open and easy access to basic and clinical investigators.

591	9619308	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) account for approximately 13% of all lung cancers (Govindan et al., 2006; Poirier et al., 2020), and are highly metastatic and rapidly chemoresistant (Gazdar et al., 2017; Sabari et al., 2017). Their genetic landscape is different from other lung cancers, with few activating driver mutations in oncogenes, near-universal loss of function-mutational prevalence in TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressor genes, and overexpression of cellular proliferation and replication pathways (Tlemsani et al., 2020). Many SCLCs also have increased copy-number changes in members of the MYC oncogene family, and/or disruptive mutations in chromatin remodeler and epigenetic genes such as histone lysine methyltransferases (KMT2D and KMT2C), and histone acetyltransferases (EP300, CREBBP) (George et al., 2015).
592	9619308	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	SCLC tumors and patient-derived cell lines and xenografts (PDXs) have recently been classified into four main subtypes based on the expression of 4 lineage-defining transcription factors (LTFs): NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3, and YAP1 (briefly referred to as “NAPY”) (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020). Further studies differentiate SCLC into ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 subtypes, and the inflammatory subtype, which benefits from combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy (Gay et al., 2021). The NEUROD1 and ASCL1 subtypes have a neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype, with elevated expression of NE markers including synaptophysin and chromogranin A. The POU2F3 and YAP1 subtypes are non-NE, with elevated NOTCH pathway expression and low expression of NE markers (Pozo et al., 2021; Tlemsani et al., 2020). Binding of the LTFs to many distinct sites in the genome has been proposed to act as enhancers and regulate different gene expression pathways that characterize each of the subtypes of SCLCs (Borromeo et al., 2016; Chakraborty et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021; Tlemsani et al., 2020).
593	9619308	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	The subtype classification of SCLC is not routinely implemented in clinical practice owing to limited access to well-preserved tumor tissues to perform immunohistochemistry analyses with many diagnostic biopsies coming from needle aspirations (Qu et al., 2022). RNA-seq analyses are also not routinely utilized to classify SCLCs based on the differential expression of the LTFs. Because of the challenges of RNA analyses and of the greater stability of DNA over RNA, DNA analyses are being effectively tested to classify subtypes of cancers, such as sarcomas (Koelsche et al., 2021). Taking advantage of the well-documented genomic databases of SCLC cell lines (Gay et al., 2021; George et al., 2015; Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020), we asked whether DNA methylation analyses based on the clinically used MethylationEPIC array could provide novel insights in the genetic regulatory pathways of SCLCs and be used as a classifier and therapeutic guide for SCLCs.
594	9619308	BODY3	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	DNA methylation is used clinically to correlate survival (Gevaert et al., 2015; Hao et al., 2017), as well as drug response (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Butler et al., 2020; Krushkal et al., 2020; Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2020). To that effect, O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG)-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is an established prognostic biomarker in glioblastomas treated with temozolomide (Butler et al., 2020), while Schlafen (SLFN11) expression inactivation through promoter methylation leads to resistance to PARP inhibitors and DNA damaging agents including etoposide, cisplatin, topotecan and lurbinectedin that are used as a standard of care for SCLCs (Kundu et al., 2021; Murai et al., 2016, 2019; Nogales et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2018). Although the DNA methylation of promoters is commonly used to predict the lack of gene expression (Butler et al., 2020; Esteller, 2021), in many cases it can give an incomplete picture when the promoters of non-expressed genes are not hypermethylated (Butler et al., 2020; Reinhold et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2018). Although many methylation probes in the 450k and 850k array platforms, widely used for detecting the methylation of specific gene regions, are outside of promoters, there have been limited analyses and use on their quantitative relationship with gene expression and on their potential translational value to predict gene expression (Lister et al., 2009; Spainhour et al., 2019; Su et al., 2018). Yet, gene body methylation has been shown to reflect gene activity (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Yang et al., 2014), suppress alternative transcript isoforms by blocking promoters, and to regulate splicing (Huang et al., 2021; Lev Maor et al., 2015; Li et al., 2018; Neri et al., 2017; Teissandier and Bourc'his, 2017; Yang et al., 2014).
595	9619308	BODY4	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Studies have begun to explore the epigenetics of SCLCs by mapping the binding sites of the LTFs (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018), the enhancers based on histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) (Pozo et al., 2021), and promoter DNA methylation (Krushkal et al., 2020; Tlemsani et al., 2020). To expand our understanding of how gene expression is regulated in SCLC and determine the potential translational value of the MethylationEPIC 850k array, we took advantage of the SCLC cell line databases (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/) and integrated whole genome DNA methylation (Krushkal et al., 2020; Tlemsani et al., 2020), enhancer H3K27ac ChIP-seq (Huang et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021) and ChIP-seq for the three main LTFs driving SCLC pathogenesis (ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3) (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). We developed algorithms to automatically quantify the levels of promoter and gene body methylation, as well as copy number and promoter acetylation for each gene. And for each epigenetic marker (DNA methylation, H3K27Ac, and ChIP-seq for ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3), we analyzed their genomic distribution and demonstrate how they mutually predict gene expression. The data are integrated in a public web-based genomic platform in our CellMinerCDB ecosystem (Luna et al., 2021), enabling individual researchers and clinicians to explore genomic and drug response correlations across the NCI, UT Southwestern, Broad-MIT (CCLE), and Welcome-Sanger databases (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/).
596	9619308	BODY5	['RESULTS', 'GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINE METHYLOME DATA AND CLASSIFICATION OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINES BASED ON THEIR METHYLOME']	RESULTS	High-resolution DNA methylation (EPIC 850K array) was obtained for 68 different SCLC patient-derived cell lines (Krushkal et al., 2020; Tlemsani et al., 2020), H3K27ac data for 18 SCLC lines (Huang et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021) and ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 ChIP-seq for 6 SCLC lines (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). We analyzed each dataset and studied their predictive value as classifiers of SCLCs and predictors of gene expression.

604	9619308	BODY13	['RESULTS', 'GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINE METHYLOME DATA AND CLASSIFICATION OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINES BASED ON THEIR METHYLOME']	RESULTS	The EPICmethylation 850K array probes are not only in promoters (40.6%), but also in genic areas (35.2%) and intergenic regions (24.2%) (Figure 1B). Compared to the 450K array, the higher resolution of the EPIC 850K methylation array has more than double the coverage in genic areas (Figure S1A). The comparison of the methylation levels of different genomic regions across all SCLC lines shows that DNA methylation probes overall tend to be hypermethylated, with approximately 58.4% (40.3–70%) of probes with beta value > 0.5 (Figure 1C, Table S2). This may be related to the fact that cell lines from SCLC express significantly higher levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3A (and DNMT3B) compared to other cancers (Figure S1B). Yet, as expected, CpG islands and promoters tend to be hypomethylated (median 22.9 and 48.4%, respectively) compared to gene body and intergenic regions (median 78%) (Figures 1C and S1C; Table S2).
605	9619308	BODY14	['RESULTS', 'GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINE METHYLOME DATA AND CLASSIFICATION OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINES BASED ON THEIR METHYLOME']	RESULTS	DNA methylation has been previously used to cluster cell lines based on the tissue of origin (Ghandi et al., 2019). Thus, we assessed whether the genome-wide EPICmethylation array would differentiate SCLC subtypes. Although the non-neuroendocrine YAP1 and NSCLC cell lines showed distinct clustering, the SCLC cell lines showed limited clustering based on their NE status using UMAP clustering of all probes (Figure 1D, Table S3). As expected, some NEUROD1 cell lines with dual ASCL1-NEUROD1 expression (Figures S1D and S1E, Table S3) clustered with the ASCL1 subgroup (Figure S1D, green arrowheads) (Tlemsani et al., 2020). UMAP clustering using CpG, promoter, gene body, and intergenic probes yielded similar results. In case of gene body and promoter probes the NEUROD1 cell lines that did not express ASCL1 had a better separation from the ASCL1 cluster (Figure S1E). Overall, we conclude that the methylation array has limited value in clustering cells into subtypes.
606	9619308	BODY15	['RESULTS', 'GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINE METHYLOME DATA AND CLASSIFICATION OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINES BASED ON THEIR METHYLOME']	RESULTS	Studies comparing gene expression and DNA methylation classically focus on the methylation of promoters, where hypermethylation is associated with low gene expression (Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2020; Reinhold et al., 2017). Yet, for many genes and across cell lines, we observed that low gene expression was observed despite low promoter methylation. This is illustrated in Figures S1F and S1G for the therapeutic response predictor Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) (Murai et al., 2019) and the mesenchymal Vimentin (VIM) genes. To extend this finding genome-wide, we selected the genes with highest SD bimodal gene expression distribution (Figure S1H), finding that more than 50% of the low-expressing cell lines showed hypomethylated promoters.
607	9619308	BODY16	['RESULTS', 'GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINE METHYLOME DATA AND CLASSIFICATION OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER CELL LINES BASED ON THEIR METHYLOME']	RESULTS	Among those genes where lack of expression fails to highly correlate with promoter hypermethylation is the methylguanine methyl transferase gene (MGMT), which is routinely analyzed in the context of temozolomide treatments (Butler et al., 2020; Farago et al., 2019; Ortiz-Barahona et al., 2020). MGMT showed a relatively low negative correlation (although significant) between promoter methylation and gene expression (Figures 1E and S1H). Detailed examination of the methylation probes in the promoter area of MGMT revealed that highly expressing cell lines showed consistent CpG hypomethylation, while cell lines with low expression displayed variable promoter methylation (Figure 1F). In addition, comparing the methylation (probe) distribution across the MGMT locus showed hypermethylation of genic probes in the highly expressing cells (Figure S1I). These observations indicate that promoter hypomethylation does not accurately predict gene expression and thus must be controlled by additional epigenetic regulatory mechanisms.
608	9619308	BODY17	['RESULTS', 'RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENE BODY METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	To explore the relationship between DNA methylation in gene bodies and gene expression (Teissandier and Bourc'his, 2017), we focused on the distribution of DNA methylation by comparing methylation in promoter (−2.5kb–2.5kb area around transcription start sites), gene body (genic area excluding promoter regions) and upstream (5kb window upstream of promoter regions) and downstream (5kb window downstream of transcription end sites) regions of genes. Stratifying a large number of genes based on their expression showed a marked difference in overall DNA methylation patterns (Figure 2A). As expected, highly expressed genes showed hypomethylation centered in promoters (upper tracings in Figure 2A), while promoter hypermethylation was observed in lowly expressed genes (lower tracing in Figure 2A). Notably, the gene body of highly expressed genes was consistently hypermethylated (top tracings), while gene bodies were significantly less methylated and more variable in genes with low or no expression (bottom tracings in Figure 2A). These methylation profiles were similar in all cell lines in the SCLC database, and the methylation types were reproducible using reduced bisulfite sequencing data obtained from the CCLE (Ghandi et al., 2019) (Figures S2A–S2C). The bisulfite data are also available in CellMinerCDB (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb) (Luna et al., 2021).Figure 2Relationship between gene body methylation, promoter DNA methylation, and gene expression(A) Genic distribution of DNA methylation based on gene expression quintiles in NCI-H69 cells.(B) Promoter and gene body methylation distribution in non-expressed, lowly expressed, and highly expressed genes.(C) Heatmaps of promoter and gene body methylation in genes with low (left) or high range (right) of expression.

616	9619308	BODY25	['RESULTS', 'RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENE BODY METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	As gene body methylation was consistently associated with expression for many genes, we created a gene-level summarization algorithm of gene body methylation taking into account all probes instead of using a single-probe approach (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Krushkal et al., 2020), and which can be used to assess independently promoter and gene body methylation. We included gene body probes outside of promoters, excluding CpG island overlapping probes, which tend to be hypomethylated (see Figure 1). In cases where a gene had multiple transcripts, we selected the transcript with the most positive correlation between gene body methylation level and gene expression. Only a very small number of very short genes such as ASCL1 could not be analyzed for gene body methylation because of insufficient probe coverage. Based on this approach, we were able to provide scores for both gene body and promoter methylation and integrated these features in SCLC-CellMinerCDB (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/sclccellminercdb).
617	9619308	BODY26	['RESULTS', 'RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENE BODY METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	Using the genome-wide methylome data from all 66 SCLC cell lines (see Figure 1A), we compared promoter and gene body methylation as a function of gene expression. The gene promoter methylation values and gene expression data were obtained from the SCLC-CellMinerCDB website (Tlemsani et al., 2020). Non-expressed genes across all SCLC cell lines (Figure 2B, left) clustered in 3 distinct groups: genes methylated both on the promoter and gene body (upper right quadrant), genes with no methylation at all (bottom left), and genes with both promoter hypomethylation and gene body methylation (upper left). By contrast, highly expressed genes (Figure 2B, right) were found to be hypomethylated on their promoters and consistently hypermethylated in their gene bodies. These analyses demonstrate that analyzing promoter methylation (bmt) is insufficient to accurately predict gene expression and that adding gene body methylation improves the gene expression correlation.
618	9619308	BODY27	['RESULTS', 'RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENE BODY METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	Figure 2C illustrates the relationship of gene expression and DNA methylation for specific genes exhibiting different expression ranges. Topoisomerase II-alpha (TOP2A) or beta-2-macroglobuin (B2M), which are housekeeping genes highly expressed across cell lines show the lack of promoter methylation and high gene body methylation, as expected (Figure 2C, upper left). By contrast, genes that are generally not expressed, such as DIRC1 and CRISP3 show concomitant hyper- or hypomethylation of both promoters and gene bodies (Figure 2C, bottom left). Additional examples demonstrating this concomitant hyper- and hypomethylation for low-expression genes are shown in Figure S2D for the GLT8D2, EYS and GJA8 genes. We also observed that the expression of genes with high range of expression such as MGMT, SLFN11, and NOTCH1 shows highest correlation with gene body methylation (Figure 2C, right) rather than promoter hypomethylation. Together these results stress the relevance of gene body methylation as a predictor of gene expression.
619	9619308	BODY28	['RESULTS', 'RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENE BODY METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	Analyzing YAP1, a driver gene for a subset of non-NE SCLCs (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020) reveals that YAP1-expressing cell lines have no hypomethylated promoter with a hypermethylated gene body (“Active” group) (Figures 2C and 2D). Many YAP1 non-expressing cell lines have either hypermethylation (“Hyper” group) or hypomethylation (“Hypo” group) of the YAP1 promoter and gene body. There are some cell lines that do not express YAP1 with a hypermethylated promoter and hypomethylated gene body (“Divergent” group). Thus, overall, the methylation categories based on both promoter and gene body methylation reveal that the “active” (low promoter methylation with high gene body methylation) group predicts the expression of YAP1 (Figure 2E).
620	9619308	BODY29	['RESULTS', 'RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENE BODY METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	Additional examples where gene body methylation predicts gene expression better than promoter methylation are provided in Figure 2F for MGMT, SLFN11 and the cell surface glycoprotein and cancer biomarker CEACAM5, which is selectively expressed in neuroendocrine SCLC cell lines (Tlemsani et al., 2020). Thus, scoring gene body methylation in addition to promoter methylation can be particularly helpful to predict gene expression for genes with a wide range of expression, and this feature has been implemented in our new SCLC-CellMinerCDB release (v.1.1) along with other features that are listed in Table S4 (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/).
621	9619308	BODY30	['RESULTS', 'ENHANCER AND SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER-LINEAGE-DEFINING TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS DISTRIBUTIONS ANDTHEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH DNA METHYLATION']	RESULTS	Because histone post-translational modifications are key epigenetic regulators, we integrated into our methylome analysis the recently available H3K27ac ChIP-seq data (Pozo et al., 2021) for eighteen of the SCLC cell lines (see Figure 1A). Our analysis identified ∼239,000 enhancers defined by H3K27ac peaks, which are mainly localized in intergenic and gene body areas, with a relatively small fraction in promoters (Figure 3A).Figure 3Enhancer landscapes in SCLC cell lines(A) Distribution of the binding sites of H3K27ac (enhancers) and the 3 LTFs ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 identified from ChIP-seq data.(B) Phylogenetic distance analysis of cell lines using the most variable enhancer sites.(C) Heatmap of most variable enhancer sites (H3K27ac).

629	9619308	BODY38	['RESULTS', 'ENHANCER AND SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER-LINEAGE-DEFINING TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS DISTRIBUTIONS ANDTHEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH DNA METHYLATION']	RESULTS	Phylogenic analysis of the H3K27ac data for the enhancers with highest range of signal intensity (to reduce background noise) across cell lines showed that the cell lines formed three main clusters, differentiating the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 subtypes, and confirming the distinct enhancer signatures of the SCLC subtypes, in agreement with the recently published super-enhancer analysis (Pozo et al., 2021). Cluster heatmap representation of the H3K27ac signals based on the 4 subtypes ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1 produced 4 main clusters (Figure 3C; Table S5). HOMER sequence motif analysis revealed that clusters 1, 2 & 3 are significantly enriched for the DNA sequence motifs of ASCL1, POU2F3, and NEUROD1 (Figure 3C, right). The fourth enhancer cluster (cluster 4) mainly differentiates the NE and non-NE subtypes, with enrichment in promoter areas (Figure S3A). Differential GO analysis showed enrichment in neuronal pathways for the ASCL1 and NEUROD1-specific enhancers, and enrichment of the extracellular matrix organization and YAP1-TAZ pathways for the non-NE clusters (Figure S3B).
630	9619308	BODY39	['RESULTS', 'ENHANCER AND SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER-LINEAGE-DEFINING TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS DISTRIBUTIONS ANDTHEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH DNA METHYLATION']	RESULTS	UMAP clustering of the enhancers with highest range of signal intensity across cell lines differentiated 2 main groups of enhancers: enhancers bound in promoter sites vs. non-promoter sites (Figure S3C, left, red points). Notably, enhancers matching the SCLC-LTF subtypes (ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3) were found enriched with non-promoter sites (Figure S3C, right). These data are consistent with the presence of multiple sites of specific enhancers and super-enhancer (SE) for each of the subtypes of SCLC cell lines located outside of promoters (Pozo et al., 2021).
631	9619308	BODY40	['RESULTS', 'ENHANCER AND SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER-LINEAGE-DEFINING TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS DISTRIBUTIONS ANDTHEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH DNA METHYLATION']	RESULTS	To analyze the relationship between H3K27 acetylation (enhancers and SEs) and the SCLC-LTFs, we analyzed the ChIP-seq data obtained for ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 in the 6 cell lines with overlapping data (see Figure 1A) (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018). Like the H3K27ac histone marks, most sites were distributed in intergenic regions or within gene bodies. Yet, the binding sites of ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 showed minor overlap (Figure 3D), which is consistent with the sequence specificity and specific distribution of each SCLC-LTF (Borromeo et al., 2016). Consistent with published results (Borromeo et al., 2016), the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 binding sites were found mainly localized outside of promoters (Figure 3A). Alignment of the genomic tracings for three representative cell lines corresponding to each subtype (NCI-H889 for ASCL1, H82 for NEUROD1 and H1048 for POU2F3) shows that the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 binding sites do not overlap with each other (Figure 3E). Furthermore, alignment with the H3K27ac data shows that the differential distribution of the LTF sites is concordant with enhancer signals in each of these regions (Figure 3E). For instance, regions bound by ASCL1 have matching active enhancers in NCI-H889 cells, but not in the other cell lines. Similar distribution could be seen in the case of the NEUROD1 sites in NCI-H82 cells and of the POU2F3 sites in NCI-H1048 cells (Figure 3E). Also, for each SCLC-LTF, the sites of LTF binding are within a short central segment with reduced H3K27ac signal corresponding to the LTF binding peaks (Figures 3E and 3F). The few overlapping binding sites across the three SCLC-LTFs show that the shared enhancers had the same lack of H3K27ac signal at the SCLC-LTF binding peaks (Figure S3E).
632	9619308	BODY41	['RESULTS', 'ENHANCER AND SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER-LINEAGE-DEFINING TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS DISTRIBUTIONS ANDTHEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH DNA METHYLATION']	RESULTS	To establish the potential relationship between LTF-specific enhancers and DNA methylation, we overlaid the DNA methylation tracings with each of the SCLC-LTF enhancer regions. This showed that the summits of the ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 ChIP-seq peaks are characterized by a dip in DNA methylation, consistent with the possibility that the SCLC-LTFs only bind unmethylated DNA sites outside of promoters and are flanked by hyperacetylated H3K27 regions (Figure 3F).
633	9619308	BODY42	['RESULTS', 'H3K27 PROMOTER ACETYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	For the enhancers localized in gene promoters (∼40,000 sites corresponding to ∼30% of the total H3K27ac signals; see Figure 3A), enhancer signals (H3K27ac) were found positively correlated with gene expression and inversely correlated with DNA methylation (Figure 4A). Highly expressed genes displayed the highest levels of H3K27ac signal, and genes with intermediate expression across cell lines displayed intermediate H3K27ac signal (Figure 4A). Figure 4B (right panels) shows representative genomic tracings and quantitative analyses performed automatically on the CellMinerCDB web portal (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/) for MGMT and SLFN11. As expected, promoter acetylation is generally highly correlated with gene expression for effector genes.Figure 4Enhancer signals (H3K27ac) in promoters strongly predict gene expression(A) Summary of genic H3K27ac and DNA methylation distribution based on gene expression.

640	9619308	BODY49	['RESULTS', 'H3K27 PROMOTER ACETYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	Promoter enhancer signals for the SCLC-LTF genes were also closely correlated with the subtypes of SCLCs (Figure 4C), and selected SCLC-relevant genes including the MYC genes (MYC, MYCL, and MYCN), the NE SCLC markers (SYP, INSM1, and CHGA) and the NOTCH genes (NOTCH1, NOTCH2 and NOTCH3) all displayed tight correlation between promoter enhancer H3K27ac signals and gene expression (Figure S4A).
641	9619308	BODY50	['RESULTS', 'H3K27 PROMOTER ACETYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	Additionally, the super enhancer (SE) signals for ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 (Pozo et al., 2021) revealed overlap for each set of SE in the corresponding subtypes, correlating with the expression levels of each of the LTFs (Figure S4B). Exploring further the relationship between enhancers determined by H3K27ac and DNA methylation, we observed that DNA methylation probes overlapping enhancers tend to be hypomethylated compared to non-enhancer sites regardless of their localization (promoters, gene bodies, and intergenic regions as well) (Figure S4C). We also observed that in the case of strong enhancers (and SEs) covering entire genes, the gene body methylation probes tended to be hypomethylated. This can be seen in the case of NEUROD1 and NKX2-1, where cell lines with high genic H3K27ac signal show low gene body methylation, resulting in a negative correlation between gene expression and gene body methylation (Figures 4D and 4E). These observations demonstrate that gene body methylation, which for most expressed genes is closely associated with transcription, is low in genes that are covered by enhancers and/or super enhancers like NEUROD1.
642	9619308	BODY51	['RESULTS', 'H3K27 PROMOTER ACETYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION']	RESULTS	To facilitate further analyses, we generated a gene-level H3K27ac summarization algorithm, which is implemented in SclcCellMinerCDB version 1.1 (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminercdb). This feature was used to generate the plots and statistical analyses shown in the right panels of Figures 4B, 4D, and 4E. We also used this algorithm to compare promoter H3K27ac, promoter, and gene body methylation and copy number (CNV) with gene expression. Promoter enhancer signal shows the strongest correlation with gene expression (Figure 4F). Gene body methylation shows better predictive power over promoter methylation in the case of genes with high range of expression; yet promoter methylation has slightly better overall predictive power when including all genes (Figure S4D). Copy-number data showed the overall lowest correlation with gene expression when comparing genes with high range of expression.
643	9619308	BODY52	['RESULTS', 'EXPLORING THE EPICMETHYLATION ARRAY FOR PRECISION MEDICINE OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER']	RESULTS	Based on the premise that two potential key elements of precision medicine are: 1) the classification of tumors in subgroups with well-defined pathways, and 2) Omics-driven therapies (Jo et al., 2021), we tested the potential of the EPIC 850k methylome array in the context of the SCLC cell lines as pilots for expansion studies in patient samples.
644	9619308	BODY53	['RESULTS', 'EXPLORING THE EPICMETHYLATION ARRAY FOR PRECISION MEDICINE OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER']	RESULTS	Regarding the classification of SCLCs, we used the “Multivariate Analyses” web tool of SclcCellMinerCDB to explore the predictive value of the EPIC array. Figure 5 displays snapshots that can be readily obtained by readers and users (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/sclccellminercdb). For NEUROD1, both promoter and gene body methylation give a highly significant prediction (p value = 1.3e-08) (Figure 5, upper left). As expected, promoter methylation (abbreviated “mth”) was negatively correlated with NEUROD1 expression. Gene body methylation (abbreviated “bmt”) is also highly correlated with NEUROD1 expression, as the NEUROD1 gene coincides with an SE (see section above and Figure 4D). Highly significant prediction is also observed for YAP1 and ASCL1 (Figure 5, middle left). In the case of YAP1, promoter methylation is highly predictive and gene body methylation is positively correlated with expression, as expected (see above) for genes not covered by an SE. For ASCL1, which is a short gene for which no gene body probes could be assigned, the predictive value of promoter methylation was very high (p value = 6.1e-10). Together, these analyses demonstrate the predictive value of the EPICmethylation array for SCLC classification based on their LTFs.Figure 5Predictive value of gene body and promoter DNA methylation to classify SCLC and assess the expression of therapeutically relevant genesThe Multivariate Analyses tool of SclcCellMinerCDB (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/sclccellminercdb) was used to generate the analyses and panels (snapshots from the website).

647	9619308	BODY56	['RESULTS', 'EXPLORING THE EPICMETHYLATION ARRAY FOR PRECISION MEDICINE OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER']	RESULTS	The predictive value of the EPIC array was tested for several therapeutically applicable genes (Figure 5, right and bottom panels). The expression of DLL3, which is specifically expressed in ASCL1-SCLC (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020) and targeted by small molecules and radioligands (Morgensztern et al., 2019; Tully et al., 2022) can be predicted with high significance (p = 7.9e-10) by combining promoter (mth) and gene body (bmt) methylation (Figure 5, upper right). Lack of expression of MGMT, which predicts response to temozolomide (Butler et al., 2020; Farago et al., 2019; Thomas et al., 2017) is highly predicted by lack of promoter and gene body methylation (p = 2.8e-13) (Figure 5, right).
648	9619308	BODY57	['RESULTS', 'EXPLORING THE EPICMETHYLATION ARRAY FOR PRECISION MEDICINE OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER']	RESULTS	Finally, we tested the expression of SLFN11 as a sensitizer and biomarker for replication-targeted therapies commonly used in SCLC (etoposide, cisplatin, topotecan, lurbinectedin) (Jo et al., 2021; Kundu et al., 2021; Murai et al., 2019; Thomas and Pommier, 2016). Immunoblot analyses on the NCI-DTP SCLC cell lines (Polley et al., 2016) demonstrated high correlation between SLFN11 protein levels (“proSLFN11” in Figure 5, bottom right) and gene expression (Pearson correlation (r) = 0.93, p value = 1.5e-26), which is consistent with our initial studies performed in the NCI60 (Zoppoli et al., 2012). Next, we tested the predictive value of the EPIC array data for SLFN11 and found very high predictive value by combining promoter and gene body methylation (r = 0.82, p value = 5.9e-17) (Figure 5, bottom right). Both parameters obtained from the EPIC array combination were also predictive of the activity of topotecan (Figure 5, bottom) with predictive value primarily driven by gene body methylation (Figure S5C) rather than promoter methylation (Figure S5D).
649	9619308	BODY58	['RESULTS', 'EXPLORING THE EPICMETHYLATION ARRAY FOR PRECISION MEDICINE OF SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER']	RESULTS	Together these analyses demonstrate the predictive value of the EPICmethylation data analyzed using the CellMinerCDB algorithms (Luna et al., 2021) to classify SCLC and potentially predict therapies.
650	9619308	BODY59	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	The SCLC-CellMiner web portal (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB/) provides a unique platform and data repository to examine multi-omics data for widely used patient-derived SCLC preclinical models with data originating from complementary sources (NCI, DepMap, UT Southwestern, Cold-spring Harbor) (Rudin et al., 2019; Tlemsani et al., 2020). SCLC-CellMiner enables researchers to directly compare and mine gene expression patterns and pathways, and determine how gene expression and mutations may be correlated and hence “predict” response to hundreds of drugs tested in the preclinical models (Polley et al., 2016; Tlemsani et al., 2020). Compared to our previously released version (Tlemsani et al., 2020), the updated version of SCLC-CellMiner integrates two new epigenetic markers: gene body methylation and promoter enhancer signals (H3K27ac). These epigenetic marks, in addition to promoter methylation and gene copy number (CNV), predict gene expression, classify SCLC cell lines, and show how omics analyses predict drug responses. These new features are summarized in Table S4.
651	9619308	BODY60	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Genomic DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT1, which recognizes and methylates hemi-methylated sites during replication. De novo DNA methylation is mainly deposited by DNMT3A and DNMT3B, which binds to histone H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4) before methylating DNA at inactive gene promoters. At actively transcribed genes, the promoters are marked by the trimethylation of H3K4, which inhibits the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A/B, leading to decreased promoter methylation levels (Otani et al., 2009; Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016; Zhang et al., 2010). As genes are transcribed by POL2, SETD2 trimethylates the core histone H3 at lysine K36, which is recognized by DNMT3B, leading to hypermethylation in the gene body (Dhayalan et al., 2010; Greenberg and Bourc'his, 2019; Hervouet et al., 2018; Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015). Gene body methylation has been proposed to enhance transcription by suppressing the firing of alternate transcripts and by facilitating splicing (Bacolod and Barany, 2021; Huang et al., 2021; Neri et al., 2017; Teissandier and Bourc'his, 2017; Yang et al., 2014). Apart from transcription, DNA methylation has been shown to be mutually exclusive of the facultative heterochromatin marker H3K27me3 (Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020). In addition, differential DNA methylation status has been seen in euchromatin (A) and heterochromatin (B) compartments, where A-compartments tended to be hypermethylated (Fortin and Hansen, 2015).
652	9619308	BODY61	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Our gene-level methylation profile analyses based on the high-resolution EPICmethylation 850K array demonstrate that genes expressed at high levels are characterized not only by promoter hypomethylation but also by gene body hypermethylation. The promoter hypomethylation valley is slightly narrower in lowly expressed genes paired with decreasing gene body methylation values. Because of this relationship, promoter methylation shows a negative correlation, while gene body methylation exhibits even higher positive correlation with gene expression levels. Looking at non-expressed genes, promoters and gene bodies are either both hypo- or hypermethylated. As transcription is lacking in these genes, methylation deposition may be coordinated by other epigenetic markers and chromatin states (Brinkman et al., 2012; Fortin and Hansen, 2015; Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015). From a translational viewpoint, our methylation algorithms (mth: promoter and bmt: gene body) demonstrate the value of the DNA EPICmethylation 850K array for predicting gene expression.
653	9619308	BODY62	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	We also observed that DNA methylation levels are lower in enhancer areas, and that genic areas covered by super-enhancers (SEs) tend to be completely hypomethylated. This is probably related to the elevated promoter mark H3K4me3, which inhibits DNA methylation deposition that extends to wider genomic regions in super-enhancers (Cao et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2018). This results in a counterintuitively negative correlation between expression and gene body methylation and corresponds to a signature of genes covered by super-enhancers, such as NEUROD1, FOXA1/2 and NKX2-1 (see Table S6).
654	9619308	BODY63	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	SCLC cell lines are classified into 4 main subtypes based on the four LTFs: ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1 (Rudin et al., 2019), and recent attempts have been made to extend this classification to clinical samples (Qu et al., 2022). Basic studies recently showed that these subtypes can be clustered using their SE activity (Borromeo et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; Pozo et al., 2021). The clustering was also visible when we used variable enhancers, not limiting to SEs. This was not surprising, as ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 binding sites have very little overlap, with elevated enhancer signal that is specific to each subtype. Additionally, DNA methylation levels are lower in the binding sites of ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3 (Yin et al., 2017). Finally, we demonstrate that promoter enhancer signal levels are strong predictors of gene expression, outperforming DNA methylation and DNA methylation-derived copy-number as well. Yet, in the absence of H3K27ac ChIP data, which is the case for clinical samples, our analyses demonstrate the potential of the DNA EPICmethylation 850K array to significantly predict gene expression and match tumors with the SCLC-LTF subgroups and with specific therapies such DLL3-based cytotoxins, temozolomide (based on lack of MGMT) and the DNA replication targeted chemotherapies (etoposide, cisplatin, camptothecin, and lurbinectedin) (based on the expression of SLFN11).
655	9619308	BODY64	['DISCUSSION', 'LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY']	CONCLUSIONS	Our study has some limitations: 1) DNA methylation was measured with 850K arrays and RRBS (reduced representation bisulfite sequencing), which cover more positions than the 450k array, are still limited to predetermined areas; 2) as gene body methylation is usually deposited through transcription, in cases where a gene is expressed in all cell lines, the gene body methylation level may be less predictive of expression levels (which is similarly seen in case of promoter methylation); 3) Our data are based on cancer cell line models. Therefore, follow-up clinical studies including both RNA-seq and EPICmethylation 850K arrays are warranted to validate the predictive value of the high-resolution DNA methylation arrays in patient samples.

660	9619308	BODY69	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'PROCESSING OF RAW METHYLATION DATA']	CONCLUSIONS	Raw methylation files (idat) format were processed in R using the minfi (v1.34.0) package (Aryee et al., 2014), normalized with the preprocessIllumina() function. Methylation data was then mapped to the hg19 genome version using the BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 (v1.4.3) package as reference. Normalized methylation values for each cell line were converted to bigwig format using the rtracklayer (v1.48.0) package (Lawrence et al., 2009).
661	9619308	BODY70	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'COMPARISON OF METHYLATION DISTRIBUTION IN THE GENOME']	CONCLUSIONS	Methylation probes were annotated to CpG islands, promoters, genic regions and intergenic regions. CpG island annotation in BED format was obtained from the UCSC site for the hg19 genome version. For genic annotation the TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene (v3.2.2) package was used. Promoters were defined as 2.5kb area upstream and downstream from the transcription start site. Genic regions between the end of the promoter and transcription end site were defined as the gene body. Probes outside of CpGs, promoters and genes were categorized as intergenic probes. Probes were denoted as hypermethylated, if the beta value was above 0.5. The most variable methylation probes were used to perform UMAP clustering of cell lines in each category using the UMAP package (v0.2.7.0) (McInnes et al., 2018) setting the random state to 1, n_components to 2, n_neighbors to 6 and min_dist to 0.01.
662	9619308	BODY71	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'DNA METHYLATION PROFILE OF GENES']	CONCLUSIONS	The gene model was defined as promoter regions (2.5Kb area upstream and downstream of transcription start site), gene body (area between promoter region and transcription end site), gene upstream area (5kb upstream of promoter), and gene downstream area (5kb downstream of transcription end site). The promoter area was divided into 25 bins, the gene body area was divided into 50 bins, while the upstream and downstream areas were divided into 10 bins each. Genes were separated by expression quintiles. For each quintile, the average signal of each bin in each gene area was calculated, and plotted in R.
663	9619308	BODY72	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'ANALYSIS OF RRBS BASED METHYLATION DATA']	CONCLUSIONS	The RRBS sequencing data for the CCLE SCLC cell lines were obtained from the SRA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra, accession number PRJNA523380). Reads were processed using the bismark (v0.22.3) pipeline (Krueger and Andrews, 2011), first aligning the reads with bismark to the hg19 genome version, followed by extracting the methylation values using the bismark_methylation_extractor with the “--comprehensive --cytosine_report --CX –bedGraph” flags to generate a comprehensive report.
664	9619308	BODY73	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'QUANTIFICATION OF GENE BODY METHYLATION']	CONCLUSIONS	Gene body methylation was obtained for every gene by calculating the mean methylation of probes overlapping gene bodies, excluding CpG probes, and probes that overlap promoter areas. In cases of genes with multiple transcripts, the transcript with the most positive correlation was selected, similar to the promoter methylation analysis (Tlemsani et al., 2020).
665	9619308	BODY74	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'ALIGNMENT AND ANALYSIS OF CHIP-SEQ DATA']	CONCLUSIONS	We obtained ChIP-seq data from GEO for H3K27ac (GSE151002 and GSE115124) and ASCL1 (GSE69398), NEUROD1 (GSE69398) and POU2F3 (GSE115124). Raw reads were trimmed using trimmomatic (v0.36) (Bolger et al., 2014), followed by read alignment using the bwa mem aligner (v 0.7.17) (Li, 2013). Reads were sorted using samtools (v1.8) (Li et al., 2009), followed by duplicate marking using picard-tools (v2.9.2). H3K27ac peaks were called using the MACS peak caller (Zhang et al., 2008) setting the “—nomodel” flag using the broad peak calling setting. ASCL1, NEUROD1 and POU2F3 peaks were called using the default settings of the MACS peak caller. Normalized sequencing depth coverages were prepared using the BAMscale (v0.06) tool (Pongor et al., 2020). Peaks were annotated using the ChIPseeker package (Yu et al., 2015). In case of the ASCL1, NEUROD1 and POU2F3 ChIP-seq experiments, we compared binding site BED files using the intervene venn program(Khan and Mathelier, 2017), which is also able to separate peaks based on the colocalization. The resulting BED files from the intervene package and bigwig files from BAMscale were used to create the colocalization heatmaps with the heatmapper script available in the BAMscale github repository (https://github.com/ncbi/BAMscale).
666	9619308	BODY75	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'ENHANCER H3K27AC ASSIGNMENT TO GENE PROMOTERS']	CONCLUSIONS	When assigning peaks to genes, we first combined peaks that had 50% overlap with each other, and quantified the gene signal with the BAMscale cov function (Pongor et al., 2020), followed by normalization with the sva package (Leek et al., 2012) and TMM-FPKM normalized using the edgeR package (Robinson et al., 2010) followed by log2(TMM-FPKM + 1) transformation. Since multiple peaks can overlap the promoter of a single gene, we prioritized peaks based on distance and average signal. Peaks were prioritized using 2500bp, 5000bp, 10000bp and 15000bp distances intervals from the TSS site, where lower distance intervals had higher priority. To select the appropriate gene and peak pair, we selected peaks which were in the highest distance priority. In cases where multiple peaks were within a priority, the peak with highest mean signal in the cell lines was selected. Finally, we selected the cell replicates that had the best correlation with expression in the top 3000 genes with highest expression range based on RNA-seq data obtained from the SCLC-CellMinerCDB.
667	9619308	BODY76	['STARMETHODS', 'METHOD DETAILS', 'BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES', 'ENHANCER H3K27AC SIGNAL ANALYSIS AND CLUSTERING IN CELL LINES']	CONCLUSIONS	Enhancer peak calls from each cell line were combined into a single peak set using bedtools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). Peak signals were quantified using BAMscale cov function (Pongor et al., 2020). Raw read counts were normalized using sva package (Leek et al., 2012) and TMM-FPKM normalized using edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010), and log2 (TMM-FPKM + 1) transformed. Since some cell lines had multiple replicates, we used the replicate that was assigned during the gene promoter assignment analysis. The most variable sites were used in the heatmap analysis, filtering for peaks with standard deviations above 1.25 in the cell lines. The heatmap was drawn using the ComplexHeatmap package (Gu et al., 2016) R package, clustering peaks into 4 groups, and separating cell lines based on their NAPY status. Peaks were annotated using the ChIPseeker (v1.28.3) R package (Yu et al., 2015). Differential pathway analysis of clusters was performed using the clusterProfiler (v4.0.5) package (Yu et al., 2012) and ReactomePA (Yu and He, 2016) in R. Peaks were also clustered using the UMAP package (v0.2.7.0) (McInnes et al., 2019) using default parameters and setting the metric to Euclidean distance. The unrooted phylogenetic tree was constructed using the APE R package (Paradis et al., 2004) using the hclust() hierarchical clustering of Z-scored peaks, setting the clustering to the “ward.D2” method.
668	9619308	BODY77	['STARMETHODS', 'QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL DETAILS']	CONCLUSIONS	Tests used to determine statistical significance include Wilcoxon signed-rank test (Figure 1C) and Pearson correlation coefficients (Figures 1E, 2D, 2F, 4B–4E, 5, S1B, S1F–S1G, S2C, and S5).
669	6594009	TITLE	['TITLE']	TITLE	A novel mutation panel for predicting etoposide resistance in small-cell lung cancer
670	6594009	ABS0	['PURPOSE']	ABSTRACT	Platinum-based chemotherapy, consisting of etoposide and cisplatin (EP), has been the cornerstone of therapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) for decades. Despite the marked initial sensitivity of SCLC to chemotherapy, EP regimens cannot avoid the emergence of drug resistance in clinical practice. With the rise of new chemotherapy regimens in recent years and the primary resistance or insensitivity of ES-SCLC to EP regimens, it is desirable to be able to identify patients with resistant or insensitive ES-SCLC.
671	6594009	ABS1	['METHODS']	ABSTRACT	The sequencing and drug sensitivity data of SCLC cell lines were provided by The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project (GDSC). The data regarding sensitivity to etoposide of 54 SCLC cell lines were analyzed, and etoposide-sensitive cell lines and etoposide-resistant cell lines were differentiated according to the IC50 values defined by the GDSC. ROC curve analysis was performed on all mutations and combinations of mutations to select the optimal panel to predict resistance to etoposide.
672	6594009	ABS2	['RESULTS']	ABSTRACT	ROC analysis of etoposide resistance revealed that the most significant single gene mutation indicating resistance to etoposide was CSMD3, and the accuracy of predicting resistance to etoposide proved to be the highest when there was any mutation in CSMD3/PCLO/RYR1/EPB41L3, area under the curve =0.804 (95% confidence interval: 0.679–0.930,P<0.001).
673	6594009	ABS3	['CONCLUSION']	ABSTRACT	This study found that a panel with four genes (CSMD3, EPB41L3, PCLO, and RYR1) can accurately predict sensitivity to etoposide. These findings provide new insights into the overall treatment for patients with ES-SCLC that is resistant or insensitive to etoposide.
674	6594009	BODY0	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	In recent years, humans have made significant progress in the early detection, early diagnosis, early treatment, and even prevention of cancer. However, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6%) and the leading cause of cancer-related death (18.4%) worldwide.1 Currently, there are approximately 2.1 million lung cancer patients worldwide.1 Approximately 12–15% of new lung cancer patients are diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).2,3 According to the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, an estimated 29,654 new cases of SCLC occurred in the United States in 2017.4,5 Studies have shown that the incidence of SCLC is attributable to cigarette smoking, and the smoking pack-years increases, so does the risk of SCLC. Ninety percent of patients with SCLC have been or are currently smokers, and smoking duration is positively associated with an increased risk of SCLC.6,7 In addition, SCLC is characterized by a high growth fraction, a high degree of malignancy, and the early development of widespread metastases.8,9 The 5-year survival rate in patients with SCLC is only 6.6%. Currently, SCLC is divided into limited-stage SCLC (LS-SCLC) and extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Unfortunately, the 5-year survival rates are only 1.6% and 12.1% for patients with ES-SCLC (1/3) and ES-SCLC (2/3),8–11 respectively.
675	6594009	BODY1	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	At present, surgery is one of the main methods of cancer treatment, but it is rarely used in the treatment of patients with SCLC. It is only suitable for a small number of stage I patients with SCLC (2%-5%) who do not have mediastinal lymph node metastasis. In the past few decades, a platinum compound in combination with the topoisomerase-II inhibitor etoposide beyond 4 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy (EP) has become the cornerstone of treatment for patients with ES-SCLC for palliative care.11–13 In recent years, the chemotherapy for ES-SCLC has mainly been irinotecan, cisplatin (IP) and EP regimens.14 Despite the substantial initial sensitivity of SCLC to chemotherapy in the early stages of treatment, more than 90% of patients eventually develop clinical drug resistance and die as a result of relapse.8,9 At present, there is a great deal of controversy about the therapeutic effect and safety tolerance of IP and EP in the treatment of ES-SCLC. In 2002, a randomized, multicenter, phase III trial (J9511) performed in Japan reported that patients with ES-SCLC who were treated with IP experienced a median survival of 12.8 months compared with 9.4 months for patients treated with EP (P=0.002). In addition, the 1-year survival rates were 58.4% vs 37.7% and the median progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 12.8 months vs 9.4 months in the IP and EP groups, respectively.15 Furthermore, Hermes et al studied 220 patients with ES-SCLC, and the results showed that the median overall survival (OS) was slightly higher in those receiving IP than in those receiving EP (8.5 months vs 7.1 months, P=0.04).16 However, it is surprising that there were no significant differences in the efficacy and survival of the IP and EP groups in 4 subsequent phase III trials.17–20 In a cohort study from Korea, the median OS and median PFS of patients with ES-SCLC treated with IP were 10.9 months and 6.5 months, respectively, whereas the median OS and PFS in the EP arm were 10.3 months (P=0.120) and 5.8 months (P=0.115), respectively. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the 1- and 2-year survival rates in the IP versus EP groups. In the subgroup analysis, males, patients <65 years old and patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≤1 were treated with IP or EP, and the two groups had significant therapeutic differences. In addition, there was a significant difference in the objective response rate (ORR) between the IP group and the EP group (62.4% vs 48.2%, P=0.006).21
676	6594009	BODY2	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	Currently, 4 to 6 cycles EP is the standard therapy widely used for a majority of SCLC in the clinic, with an ORR of 50%-80%.22 However, the median OS of patients with ES-SCLC is only 9 months, with only 2% of patients surviving after 5 years.14,23 Although SCLC usually responds well to chemotherapy regimens in the early stages of treatment, subsequent clinical drug resistance and disease recurrence occur in more than 90% of patients.8,9 This may be due to the existence of cancer stem cells that are relatively resistant to cytotoxic therapy. Chemotherapy cannot destroy residual tumor cells, leading to a high recurrence rate and a high drug resistance rate in SCLC.24 Primary resistance or acquired resistance to chemotherapy is a major factor in the poor prognosis of patients with lung cancer.25–27 In the drug sensitivity data from GDSC, we found that the IC50 of etoposide in the 54 SCLC cell lines ranged from 0.242 μM to 319 μM, and the drug resistance cut-off value provided by the website was 16 μM. In total, 65% of patients have SCLC that is sensitive to etoposide, which is close to the response rate for etoposide.28 Therefore, if we are able to select patients with ES-SLCL that is not sensitive to etoposide before treating them with standard chemotherapy, we could choose a different chemotherapy regimen to treat these patients, hopefully improving survival outcomes in those ES-SCLC patients. Survival time was significantly improved with the new chemotherapy compared with EP. However, there is currently no clinically relevant prediction factor and screening for appropriate means of insensitivity to etoposide.
677	6594009	BODY3	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	To date, a growing number of studies have shown that the emergence of primary or acquired platinum and Topoisomerase Inhibitors resistance in EP is associated with certain gene expression changes or/and gene mutations.29 Chiu et al30 found that FBXL7 is a biomarker of poor prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer. A high expression level of FBXL7 is positively associated with a low survival rate in ovarian cancer patients, and the FBXL7 mRNA level and ovarian cancer cell line paclitaxel (PTX) IC50 values were positively correlated, leading to the speculation that the upregulation of FBXL7 expression results in resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. In addition, Chiu et al31 detected the transcriptional level of the shared gene in HCC38 (PTX-sensitive) and MDA-MB436 (PTX-resistant) TNBC cells posttreatment with paclitaxel. They found that the downregulation of miR-1180 may regulate OTUD7B, ultimately negatively regulating the NF-κB-Lin28 axis. This in turn triggers Let-7 microRNA-mediated caspase-3 downregulation, ultimately leading to resistance to PTX. Based on these findings, the sensitivity and drug resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy can be predicted by gene expression levels. Thus, patients with ES-SLCL that is sensitive or insensitive to chemotherapy can be further distinguished. We hope that the sensitivity of ES-SCLC to etoposide can be predicted by gene mutation panels, allowing the selection of patients with ES-SCLC that is insensitive to etoposide before standard chemotherapy is administered and the development of personalized, precise chemotherapy to extend patients’ OS and improve their quality of life (QOL).
678	6594009	BODY4	['INTRODUCTION']	BACKGROUND	To this end, we analyzed the sequencing and drug sensitivity data for a SCLC cell line through the GDSC database to determine whether mutations can predict the primary resistance to etoposide and try to explain the potential underlying mechanism to provide first-line treatment recommendations for patients with ES-SCLC.
679	6594009	BODY5	['METHODS', 'DRUG RESPONSE, GENE EXPRESSION AND MUTATION DATA']	METHODS	The natural logarithm half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of all selected erlotinib-related cell lines were obtained from the GDSC (https://www.cancerrxgene.org/). Robust Multichip Average (RMA) normalized expression data from the Affymetrix Human Genome U219 array and gene mutation information found in cell lines by Illumina HiSeq 2000 whole-exome sequencing (WES) were downloaded from the GDSC.
680	6594009	BODY6	['METHODS', 'SCREENING OF MUTATED RESISTANCE GENES']	METHODS	There were 54 SCLC cell lines in the GDSC with drug sensitivity data for etoposide. The GDSC site defined etoposide-resistant cell lines as those with IC50 values ≥16 μM and etoposide-sensitive cell lines as those with IC50 values <16 μM. ROC curve analysis was performed for all mutations, and the cell lines with areas under the curve (AUCs) >0.5 were selected and randomly combined; then, resistance to etoposide was predicted by the combined mutation panels. The Youden Index values obtained by various combined ROC analyses were sorted to select the best combination.
681	6594009	BODY7	['METHODS', 'STATISTICAL ANALYSIS']	METHODS	The IC50 distribution for etoposide in various cell lines was obtained with the GDSC web tool. ROC analysis and mapping were performed with SPSS 21.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation); mutation and gene expression data were analyzed and mapped with the maftools32 and limma packages33 in R. In the differential analysis of the gene expression profiles, P<0.05 and FC>1.5 orFC<2/3 were considered to indicate significant differences. The survival analysis was with the log-rank test after the Kaplan-Meier analysis to investigate the predictive ability of a mutation panel with regard to survival. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in this study were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/).
682	6594009	BODY8	['RESULTS']	RESULTS	The sensitivity of cancer cell lines to drugs is mainly expressed as the IC50 value, which refers to the concentration of drug that kills half of the tumor cells in vitro. Because the drug concentration is diluted to 1/10 or 1/100, we used lnIC50 values to distinguish between resistant or sensitive cell lines. Based on the GDCS 7.0 database (updated on March 20, 2018), there are 64 SCLC cell lines, but only 54 of them have etoposide susceptibility data (drug sensitivity data), WES mutation data and RNA Seq data.
683	6594009	BODY9	['RESULTS']	RESULTS	Using the GDSC website tools, we obtained the IC50 distribution for etoposide by tissue type (Figure 1A). We found that most of the tumors are sensitive to etoposide, and the IC50 values of most cell SCLC lines indicate that they are sensitive to etoposide. By analyzing the IC50 values of the 54 SCLC cell lines shown in Figure 1B, we found that there are 35 cell lines that are sensitive to etoposide, accounting for 64.8% of the total, and their median and mean IC50 values were 2.06 μM (range: 0.242–15.2 μM) and 4.02±4.07 μM, respectively. In total, 19 strains were resistant to etoposide, accounting for 35.2% of the total, and their median and mean IC50 values were 50.0 μM (range: 16.4–319.0 μM) and 71.9±71.8 μM, respectively. The raw data for the IC50 values of all cell lines with regard to etoposide can be found in Table S1.Figure 1(A) IC50 distribution for etoposide by tissue type.

686	6594009	BODY12	['RESULTS']	RESULTS	After sorting the IC50 values for etoposide, we found that in the mutation landscape of the 54 SCLC cell lines (Figure 2), the genes with the highest mutation frequencies were TP53 (91%), TTN (78%) and Rb1 (70%). Among them, TP53 and TTN mutations were mainly missense mutations, while the Rb1 mutations were mainly nonsense and splice mutations.Figure 2Mutation landscape of 54 SCLC cell lines.Abbreviation: SCLC, small-cell lung cancer.

689	6594009	BODY15	['RESULTS']	RESULTS	We performed an ROC analysis of to predict etoposide resistance using all mutated genes (see Table S2). From the ROC curves, we found that the most significant single gene mutation associated with resistance to etoposide was CSMD3, with an AUC of 0.697 (P=0.016) (Table 1). By experimenting with different combinations, we found that when any mutations occurred in CSMD3/PCLO/RYR1/EPB41L3, the accuracy of predicting resistance to etoposide was the highest (AUC=0.804, 95% CI: 0.679–0.930, P<0.001) (Table 1). The ROC curve results of the panel composed of CSMD3/PCLO/RYR1/EPB41L3 and the individual genes are shown in Figure 3A.Table 1Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis for four-gene panel and four genes separately to etoposide resistance status in small-cell lung cancer cell linesGeneArea under curve95% confidence intervalSensitivitySpecificityYouden indexP-valueCSMD30.6970.546–0.8480.6000.7940.3940.016PCLO0.5910.429–0.7540.3000.8820.1820.267RYR10.6310.469–0.7920.3500.9120.2620.111EPB41L30.6100.447–0.7740.2500.9710.2210.179Panel0.8040.679–0.9300.8500.7060.556<0.001Figure 3(A) ROC curve of the panel and four mutations; (B) Kaplan–Meier overall survival analyses for the four-gene panel in clincal trial of SCLC.Abbreviation: SCLC, small-cell lung cancer.

By analyzing significantly enriched KEGG pathways of DEGs, we found that there was a significant association between both CSMD3 and RYR1 mutations and MAPK signaling pathway (P=0.015 and P=0.023, respectively) (Table 2).Table 2Significantly enriched KEGG pathways of DEGsMutationTermCountP-valueCSMD3hsa04142: Lysosome80.002hsa04010: MAPK signaling pathway100.015hsa05230: Central carbon metabolism in cancer50.016hsa04610: Complement and coagulation cascades50.021hsa01130: Biosynthesis of antibiotics80.044EPB41L3hsa01200: Carbon metabolism80.003hsa01130: Biosynthesis of antibiotics110.004hsa01100: Metabolic pathways330.010hsa00020: Citrate cycle (TCA cycle)40.015hsa04730: Long-term depression50.020hsa04130: SNARE interactions in vesicular transport40.021hsa04720: Long-term potentiation50.028hsa03022: Basal transcription factors40.044hsa04726: Serotonergic synapse60.045PCLOhsa04810: Regulation of actin cytoskeleton11<0.001hsa04151: PI3K-Akt signaling pathway120.005hsa04510: Focal adhesion90.005hsa04512: ECM-receptor interaction60.005hsa03320: PPAR signaling pathway50.011hsa05205: Proteoglycans in cancer80.016hsa05160: Hepatitis C60.031hsa05231: Choline metabolism in cancer50.044RYR1hsa00500: Starch and sucrose metabolism30.019hsa04010: MAPK signaling pathway60.023hsa04960: Aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption30.026hsa00280: Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation30.037hsa01130: Biosynthesis of antibiotics50.048Abbreviations: MAPK, mitogen activated kinase-like protein; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; SNARE, small NF90 (ILF3) associated RNA E; PI3K-Akt:phosphoinositide-3-kinase/serine threonine kinase; ECM, extracellular matrix; PPAR, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors.

696	6594009	BODY22	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	EP has been the most common therapy for ES-SCLC for decades. As a standard treatment, it can inhibit tumor proliferation, relieve clinical symptoms, and achieve ideal results.13,34–37 We found that 19 (35.2%) of the 54 SCLC cell lines were insensitive to etoposide according to the data from the GDSC. Currently, the clinically accepted ORR of EP is 50–80%.23 Based on the above findings, the majority of patients with SCLC do not receive survival benefits from EP, indicating that screening for patients with primary resistance to etoposide is necessary. Therefore, this study further analyzed the mutation, gene expression and etoposide sensitivity data of 54 ES-SCLC cell lines obtained from the GDSC. We identified four genes, namely, CSMD3, EPB41L3, PCLO, and RYR1; mutations in these genes predict resistance to etoposide. The predictive sensitivity this four-gene panel for resistance to etoposide is as high as 85%, with 77.8% accuracy when screening for patients with primary etoposide resistance. In addition, the ROC showed an AUC of 0.804 (95% CI 0.679–0.930), and the model was considered to have a high degree of confidence.
697	6594009	BODY23	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	Recently, a small phase III trial performed in Japan compared the efficacy of IP and EP in patients with ES-SCLC15. The trial results showed a higher median OS (12.8 months vs 9.4 months), 1-year survival rate (58.4% vs 37.7%) and 2-year survival rate (19.5% vs 5.2%) after IP than after EP. In addition, Hermes et al16 studied 220 patients with ES-SCLC, and the results showed a longer median OS resulting from the IP regimen compared with the EP regimen (8.5 months vs 7.1 months, P=0.04).
698	6594009	BODY24	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	We analyzed the data and found that mutations in both CSMD3 and RYR1 can cause the activation of the downstream MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 4). In addition, Liu et al36 found that etoposide activates the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, inhibits p53 expression and enhances c-Myc expression to decrease the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy in. Therefore, we hypothesized that mutations in the CSMD3 and RYR1 genes may cause a significant resistance to etoposide in ES-SCLC via the downstream MAPK signaling pathway. It is well known that etoposide induces DNA double-strand breakage (DSB) and triggers the DNA damage response by activating the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene (ATM) DNA repair is a process of energy dissipation, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes participate in DSB repair.37 In aerobic conditions, tumor cells preferentially perform glycolysis rather than providing energy for cell growth through the more efficient oxidative phosphorylation pathway and are therefore characterized by high glucose uptake, glycolysis activity levels and lactic acid content in the metabolites. Glycolysis consumes more glucose but produces less ATP.38 The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway promotes aerobic glycolysis by upregulating cell surface glucose transporters39 and glycolytic enzymes in tumor cells.40,41 Surprisingly, we found that the mutation of the EPB41L3 gene caused increased activity of the glucose metabolism pathway in tumor cells. Therefore, we speculate that mutations in EPB41L3 may reduce sensitivity to etoposide through DNA repair in tumor cells. In addition, AKT is involved in the repair of DNA damage caused by genotoxicity, mainly by the action of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the kinase ATM/ATM and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) to repair DSB.42 Makinoshima et al43 found that PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling inhibitors can effectively inhibit the expression of GLUT1 on the cell membrane. They used RNAi to interfere with the expression of GLUT1, ultimately reducing the aerobic glycolysis process and cell proliferation rate. Furthermore, our results suggest that PCLO mutations cause activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, so we hypothesized that PCLO mutations may enhance glucose metabolism by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby enhance the ability of the tumor cell to repair DNA.Figure 4Potential mechanism of the four-gene panel to predict the resistance of etoposide in SCLC.Abbreviation: SCLC, small-cell lung cancer.

701	6594009	BODY27	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	"Identifying outpatients with ES-SCLC that is not sensitive to etoposide and treating them with another combination therapy are important steps in improving the survival of patients with SCLC. Screening for the sensitivity to etoposide in patients with SCLC who are receiving chemotherapy for the first time allows clinicians to use a different combination chemotherapy regimen (Table 3) in these patients to avoid treatment failure due to primary resistance to etoposide. Currently, alternative treatment options that are commonly used in clinical practice include IP protocols, platinum-based drugs plus paclitaxel, and IP plus sunitinib. A phase II clinical trial (NCT00454324) on the use of a platinum-based compound plus paclitaxel in patients with ES-SCLC has shown good efficacy.44 In a phase II clinical trial (NCT00695292),45 sunitinib combined with IP for patients with ES-SCLC showed potential clinical efficacy and safety, with an ORR of 59%, a one-year survival rate of 54% and a median PFS of 7.6 months. In recent years, combinations of various chemotherapy regimens have been shown to provide excellent survival advantages in patients with ES-SCLC. It may be possible to classify patients by adding inclusion criteria and then use a more specific new chemotherapy regimen as a clinical treatment to achieve individualized and precise treatment of ES-SCLC patients, overcoming the treatment bottleneck for patients with ES-SCLC that is resistant to EP and ultimately prolonging their survival time and improving their QOL.Table 3Completed/ongoing clinical trials of alternative treatment of etoposide in SCLC patientsDrug nameClincal phaseCommentsNCT No.TreatmentPathway/targetIrinotecan3NCT00168896Carboplatin+IrinotecanTopoisomerase 12NCT014413492NCT01441349Carboplatin+Sunitinib+Irinotecan2NCT006952921NCT00045604Cisplatin+Irinotecan+Imatinib1c-kit positiveNCT000524942NCT002484821NCT00059761Cisplatin+Irinotecan2NCT014413492NCT01441349Cisplatin+Simvastatin+Irinotecan2NCT004526342NCT00546130Cisplatin+Krestin+Irinotecan2NCT00118235Cisplatin+Irinotecan+BevacizumabBevacizumab2NCT00118235Cisplatin+Irinotecan+BevacizumabVEGFPemetrexed2NCT00051506Carboplatin+PemetrexedTS, DHFR,GARFT2NCT004940262NCT00051506Cisplatin+Pemetrexed2NCT00475657Dimethylxanthenone Acetic Acid (DMXAA)2NCT01057342Carboplatin+Dimethylxanthenone Acetic Acid (DMXAA)+PaclitaxelDT-diaphorasePaclitaxel2NCT01057342Carboplatin+Dimethylxanthenone Acetic Acid (DMXAA)+PaclitaxelMitosis;Microtubule stabiliser2NCT00454324Carboplatin+Paclitaxel1NCT02069158Carboplatin+Paclitaxel+PF-05212384PF-052123841NCT02069158Carboplatin+Paclitaxel+PF-05212384PI3K/mTOR;PI3Kα, PI3Kγ,mTORGemcitabine2NCT02722369Carboplatin+GemcitabineDNA replication;Pyrimidine antimetabolitePegfilgrastim2Be able to receive growth factors (G-CSF)NCT01076504Carboplatin+Pegfilgrastim+AmrubicinGranulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor; Neutrophil elastaseAmrubicin2Be able to receive growth factors (G-CSF)NCT01076504Carboplatin+Pegfilgrastim+AmrubicinTopoisomerase 2Sunitinib2NCT00695292Carboplatin+Sunitinib+IrinotecanRTK signaling;PDGFR, KIT, VEGFR, FLT3, RET, CSF1RTopotecan2NCT00316186Carboplatin+TopotecanDNA topoisomerases3NCT00043927Cisplatin+Topotecan2NCT00028925Carboplatin+Topotecan+G-CSFBelotecan3NCT00826644Cisplatin+BelotecanHDACImatinib2NCT00248482Cisplatin+Irinotecan+ImatinibRTK signaling;ABL, KIT, PDGFR1NCT000456041c-kit positiveNCT00052494Simvastatin2NCT01441349Cisplatin+Simvastatin+IrinotecanHMG-CoA Reductase2NCT004526342NCT01441349Carboplatin+Irinotecan+SimvastatinKrestin2NCT00546130Cisplatin+Krestin+IrinotecanApoptosis;p21(WAF/Cip1)Sagopilone2NCT00359359Cisplatin+SagopiloneMicrotubule stabiliserNotes: TS, Thymidylate Synthetase; DHFR, Dihydrofolate Reductase; GARFT, Formylglycinamide Ribotide Amidotransferase; PI3K/mTOR, Phosphoinosmde-3-Kinase/The Mammalian Target of Rapamycin; HMG-CoA, Hydroxy Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase; RTK, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase; PDGFR, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptors; KIT, KIT proto-oncogene, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase; VEGFR, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor; FLT3, Fms Related Tyrosine Kinase; RET, Ret Proto-Oncogene; CSF1R, Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor; HDAC, Histone Deacetylase; ABL, Abl Tyrosine Kinase; p21(WAF/Cip1), Cyclin Dependent Kinase Inhibitor; G-CSF, granulocyte colony stimulating factor; SCLC,small-cell lung cancer.

704	6594009	BODY30	['DISCUSSION']	CONCLUSIONS	There were some limitations in this study. First, the most suitable alternative drug at present is irinotecan. GDSC does not provide data regarding the sensitivity to irinotecan, and the sensitivity of etoposide-resistant ES-SCLC to irinotecan is still unclear. Second, currently, there are no suitable large-sample clinical datasets that directly support our conclusions, and relevant clinical research needs to be further conducted to verify our hypothesis; moreover, we have initialed a clinical trial(NCT03162705) and hope this onging clincal trial could provide more direct evidence onni. Third, the accuracy of the model prediction is inadequate, and it may be necessary to expand the model to optimize it.
705	6594009	BODY31	['CONCLUSION']	CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion, we analyzed the mutation and gene expression data from the GDSC of 54 ES-SCLC cell lines with regard to etoposide susceptibility and found that the panel including CSMD3, EPB41L3, PCLO, and RYR1 can likely predict the sensitivity of ES-SCLC to etoposide and, therefore, the clinical survival of patients with SCLC.
