        <p>In this study from Oser et al., the authors investigated how RB1 loss causes a neuroendocrine phenotype in different tumor types. They show that histone demethylase KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A) promotes small cell lung cancer (SCLC) proliferation and SCLCs neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype through sustained expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1 by repressing NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes, thereby establishing a role for KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>More than 90% of small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) harbor loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene <italic>RB1</italic>. The canonical function of the <italic>RB1</italic> gene product, pRB, is to repress the E2F transcription factor family, but pRB also functions to regulate cellular differentiation in part through its binding to the histone demethylase KDM5A (also known as RBP2 or JARID1A). We show that KDM5A promotes SCLC proliferation and SCLC's neuroendocrine differentiation phenotype in part by sustaining expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factor ASCL1. Mechanistically, we found that KDM5A sustains ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation by repressing NOTCH2 and NOTCH target genes. To test the role of KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis in vivo, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based mouse model of SCLC by delivering an adenovirus (or an adeno-associated virus [AAV]) that expresses Cre recombinase and sgRNAs targeting <italic>Rb1, Tp53</italic>, and <italic>Rbl2</italic> into the lungs of Lox-Stop-Lox Cas9 mice. Coinclusion of a KDM5A sgRNA decreased SCLC tumorigenesis and metastasis, and the SCLCs that formed despite the absence of KDM5A had higher NOTCH activity compared to <italic>KDM5A</italic><sup>+/+</sup> SCLCs. This work establishes a role for KDM5A in SCLC tumorigenesis and suggests that KDM5 inhibitors should be explored as treatments for SCLC.</p>

  <body><p>Small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) are high-grade neuroendocrine tumors that account for &#8764;15% of lung cancers (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC23" ref-type="bibr">Kalemkerian et al. 2013</xref>). Almost all SCLCs highly express either ASCL1 (in 70% of cases) or NEUROD1 (in 20% of cases) (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC11" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al. 2014</xref>; <xref rid="GAD328336OSEC19" ref-type="bibr">George et al. 2015</xref>; <xref rid="GAD328336OSEC5" ref-type="bibr">Borromeo et al. 2016</xref>), which are both neuronal/neuroendocrine lineage transcription factors (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC40" ref-type="bibr">Pattyn et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="GAD328336OSEC17" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="GAD328336OSEC8" ref-type="bibr">Chanda et al. 2014</xref>). In SCLC, ASCL1 activates genes involved in neuroendocrine differentiation and lung development, as well as known SCLC proto-oncogenes such as <italic>MYCL1</italic>, <italic>NKX2.1</italic>, and <italic>SOX2</italic> (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC5" ref-type="bibr">Borromeo et al. 2016</xref>). ASCL1 is required for survival in SCLC cell lines (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC2" ref-type="bibr">Augustyn et al. 2014</xref>) and for tumor initiation in a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC5" ref-type="bibr">Borromeo et al. 2016</xref>), suggesting that maintenance of the neuroendocrine differentiation state in SCLC is necessary to sustain tumor growth. However, the mechanisms that drive high ASCL1 expression in SCLC are not well understood.</p><p>Approximately 25% of SCLCs have mutually exclusive loss of function (LOF) mutations in <italic>NOTCH</italic> receptors (<italic>NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3,</italic> and <italic>NOTCH4</italic>) (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC19" ref-type="bibr">George et al. 2015</xref>). Reexpression of the transcriptionally active intracellular domain (ICD) of NOTCH1 (NOTCH1-ICD) or NOTCH2 (NOTCH2-ICD) slows SCLC cell proliferation in vitro and inhibits tumor formation in vivo in a SCLC GEMM (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC19" ref-type="bibr">George et al. 2015</xref>), demonstrating that NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 function as tumor suppressors in SCLC. Reexpression of NOTCH-ICD also dramatically decreases ASCL1 expression (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC19" ref-type="bibr">George et al. 2015</xref>), suggesting that low NOTCH activity in SCLC is required to sustain ASCL1 levels and maintain neuroendocrine differentiation.

Remarkably, nine of the top 20 genes up-regulated by N2-ICD were also significantly up-regulated upon KDM5A knockdown (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gad.328336.119/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S2H</ext-link>).</p><p>The top 20 target genes down-regulated by N2-ICD included <italic>ASCL1</italic> and the neuroendocrine transcription factor <italic>INSM1</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gad.328336.119/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S2G</ext-link>), which is regulated by ASCL1 (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC5" ref-type="bibr">Borromeo et al. 2016</xref>).

Together, these data show that there is substantial overlap between the transcriptional signatures of KDM5A inactivation and NOTCH2 overexpression that converge on ASCL1 regulation and neuroendocrine differentiation.</p><p>In the simplest model, KDM5A represses NOTCH2 to sustain neuroendocrine differentiation in SCLC. To test this directly, we performed an epistasis experiment by inactivating <italic>NOTCH2</italic> and <italic>KDM5A</italic>, alone or in combination, in GLC16 cells using CRISPR/Cas9. A nontargeting sgRNA was used as a control. Consistent with our previous results, inactivating <italic>KDM5A</italic> alone dramatically decreased ASCL1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GAD328336OSEF3">Fig. 3</xref>I). Strikingly, ASCL1 levels were completely restored in KDM5A knockdown cells where NOTCH2 was also inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="GAD328336OSEF3">Fig. 3</xref>I). Furthermore, a &#947;-secretase inhibitor that blocks NOTCH activation at the plasma membrane also restored ASCL1 levels in cells in which KDM5A was inactivated using CRISPR/Cas9 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" ns0:href="http://genesdev.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gad.328336.119/-/DC1">Supplemental Fig. S1I</ext-link>). Therefore, KDM5A's ability to sustain ASCL1 levels and neuroendocrine differentiation is NOTCH2-dependent.</p><p>Similar to our findings with KDM5A, LSD1, which demethylates monomethylated H3K4 (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC46" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 2004</xref>), was recently shown to be a dependency in SCLC through its ability to repress NOTCH and sustain ASCL1 (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC1" ref-type="bibr">Augert et al. 2019</xref>). Given that KDM5A and LSD1 both converge on H3K4 methylation (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC46" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="GAD328336OSEC10" ref-type="bibr">Christensen et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="GAD328336OSEC25" ref-type="bibr">Klose et al. 2007</xref>), we hypothesized that combined inhibition of KDM5A and LSD1 would be synergistic. To test this, we treated NCI-H69 and NCI-H1876 cells with varying concentrations of KDM5-C70 alone, the LSD1 inhibitor ORY-1001 alone, or both inhibitors.

However, targeting mechanisms that indirectly promote ASCL1 activity, such as inhibiting proteins that normally function to increase <italic>ASCL1</italic> mRNA expression, could indirectly inhibit ASCL1. Using both genetic and pharmacological tools, we showed that inhibiting KDM5A decreases ASCL1 expression in SCLC cell lines, suggesting that KDM5A inhibition could be used as a therapeutic strategy to target ASCL1.

A caveat with our study is that the pharmacological inhibitor we used, KDM5-C70, is selective for KDM5 demethylases, but inhibits all four KDM5 family members at nearly equivalent IC50 values (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC22" ref-type="bibr">Johansson et al. 2016</xref>). It is also notable that the antitumor effects that we observed upon genetically ablating <italic>Kdm5a</italic> in our mouse model, though reproducible, were relatively modest. We suspect that this reflects the fact that <italic>Kdm5a</italic> was inactivated at or near the time of initiation, coupled with strong selective pressure for escape mechanisms when an oncogene is inactivated. Indeed, we observed similar effect sizes when we eliminated the SCLC oncoprotein <italic>Ascl1</italic> instead of <italic>Kdm5a</italic> in our mouse model (MG Oser and WG Kaelin, unpubl.). We imagine that the effects of inactivating <italic>Kdm5a</italic> might have been greater had we acutely inactivated it in established tumors.</p><p>Our preclinical data suggests that combining a KDM5 inhibitor with an LSD1 inhibitor would synergistically suppress ASCL1, which could result in increased efficacy compared with treatment with a KDM5 inhibitor or LSD1 inhibitor alone. Notably, SCLCs are selectively sensitive to an LSD1 inhibitor compared with other adult solid tumors (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC34" ref-type="bibr">Mohammad et al. 2015</xref>). A recent study demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 had striking efficacy in some patient-derived SCLC xenograft models (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC1" ref-type="bibr">Augert et al. 2019</xref>), which was associated with activation of NOTCH signaling and repression of ASCL1. Our findings provide a further rationale for developing drugs that specifically inhibit KDM5A and for testing them in preclinical SCLC models alone or in combination with LSD1 inhibitors.</p><p>We developed a new SCLC GEMM using CRISPR/Cas9 to simultaneously inactivate <italic>Rb1, Trp53,</italic> and <italic>Rbl2</italic> in the lung. We also showed that this method can be used to rapidly ask whether inactivating a fourth gene (in our case, <italic>Kdm5a</italic>) can alter the natural history of SCLC. Therefore, this model can be used to interrogate candidate oncoproteins, tumor suppressors, or therapeutic targets without the need for complex and time-consuming breeding strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first SCLC GEMM developed on a pure congenic background, which allows cell lines established from this model to be used for syngeneic transplant studies. Our model is well suited to study response and resistance of SCLC to immunotherapies, which is timely, since the PD-L1 checkpoint blockade antibody Atezolizomab has recently been shown to improve survival when given with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for SCLC patients (<xref rid="GAD328336OSEC20" ref-type="bibr">Horn et al. 2018</xref>). Furthermore, cell lines derived from our SCLC GEMM stably express Cas9 and therefore could be used directly to perform CRISPR/Cas9 screens to nominate potential SCLC oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, or genes that modulate response or resistance to targeted therapy or immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>NCI-H1417 (obtained 6/2017), NCI-H1876 (obtained 11/2016), NCI-H2081 (obtained in 11/2018), NCI-H1694 (obtained in 11/2018), NCI-H446 (obtained in 3/2016), and 293FT cells were originally obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Tumor doubling times were calculated based on the tumor volume measurements.</p><p>Mice were euthanized when they became symptomatic (primarily respiratory distress), moribund, or lost 15% of their total body weight. (All mice injected with adenovirus were included in the final analysis except for two mice [#188 and #189]. These two mice died after the first MRI imaging session, likely related to anesthesia, and did not have tumors by MRI or necropsy.) Half of the lung tumor specimen was immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent DNA and RNA analysis, while the other half was fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h and then stored in 70% ethanol. Liver and kidney/adrenals were also harvested and fixed in formalin as above to determine whether metastasis occurred. The tissues were then embedded in paraffin. Slides were made for hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and analyzed by a pathologist.</p></sec><sec id="s3y"><title>Mouse MRI imaging</title><p>MRI experiments were performed on a Bruker BioSpec 7T/30-cm USR horizontal bore Superconducting Magnet System (Bruker Corp.) equipped with the B-GA12S2 gradient and integrated with a second-order room-temperature shim system, which provides a maximum gradient amplitude of 440 mT/m and slew rate of 3440 T/m/s. The Bruker-made 23-mm ID birdcage volume radiofrequency (RF) coil was used for both RF excitation and receiving. The Bruker AutoPac with laser positioning was used for accurate definition of the region of interest. Animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane mixed in medical air at a flow rate of 2 L/min. Body temperature was maintained at 37&#176;C using a warm air fan. A pressure-transducer for respiratory gating was placed on the abdomen. Animal respiration and temperature were monitored and regulated by the SAII (SA Instruments Inc., Stony Brook, NY) monitoring and gating system model 1025T. Bruker Paravision 6.0.1 was used for MRI data acquisition. T2 weighted images of the lungs were obtained using a fast spin echo (RARE) with fat suppression sequence with the following parameters: TR = 1773 ms, TE = 36 ms, Rare Factor = 8, Number of Averages = 8, total acquisition time 4 min 40 sec, FOV = 24 &#215; 24 mm<sup>2</sup>, matrix size = 192 &#215; 256, spatial resolution = 125 &#215; 117 &#181;m<sup>2</sup>, slice thickness = 1.0 mm, number of slices = 20, and a total acquisition time of 7:30 min. Images were analyzed with the semi-automatic segmentation analysis software ClinicalVolumes (ClinicalVolumes, London, UK). A region of interest (ROI) delineating the tumor lesion was defined on each slice, and the total tumor volume was computed as the sum of all the ROI-defined areas.</p></sec><sec id="s3z"><title>CRISPR-amplicon sequencing</title><p>Tumors were harvested from LSL-Cas9 mice that were injected with the specified AAV or adenovirus and flash frozen at &#8722;80&#176;C.
